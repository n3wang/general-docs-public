Some thoughts on the Ritual Expansion
## The Woods 
Style - 1 vs all
Inspired from The Ritual (2017) 
- Now every block from now on seems to be in a forest, Every time you find a place you have to roll a dice if it is > Intelligence save for revealing otherwise it is just woods. All items are lost there. 
- A player that ends in an forest block receives a 1 sanity damage
- Forest blocks are considered obstacles

**Enemy: Jotunn**
- When you start your turn the block you are standing in becomes a forest block
- **Forest madness** : Once per turn. You can spend one sanity to make the current block a forest block.
- Add 1/2/2/3 points to each of your stats that will be our base level. 
- You cant use items. Any items at the start becomes and additional trait increase
- If by the end of the block you end in an forest block you recover one trait of your selection
- When any of your traits becomes 0 you die. 


## The Cure

- Playstyle: All cooperative
- Your friend has been bitten, teleport all to the kitchen, where you are all looking to help him find the cure. It wont take much till he fully converts, you explorrers came to the mansion to help your friend find the cure but time is running out
- Now the player that activated the event no longer plays as the player he becomes the dungeon master
- While you are rooting for your friends choose five doors in constitution save to block the entries of zombies.


**Zombies**
- Zombies will find the nearest player if more than one are the nearest you choose the nearest
- They are stunned if hit, if hit when stunned they die.

**Finding the Cure**
