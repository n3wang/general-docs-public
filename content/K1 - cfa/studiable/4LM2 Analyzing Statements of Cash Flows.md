LO: describe how the cash flow statement is linked to the income statement and the balance sheet Cash is an asset. 
?x
The cash flow statement ultimately shows the change in cash during an accounting period. The beginning and ending balances of cash are shown on the balance sheet and the bottom of the cash flow statement reconciles beginning cash with ending cash. Because a company’s operating activities are reported on an accrual basis in the income statement, any differences between the accrual basis and cash basis for accounting result in an increase or decrease in some asset or liability on the balance sheet.

| **Income Statement**    | Net income is the starting point for the **operating activities** section of the cash flow statement.      | Net income of $100,000 is adjusted for non-cash items (e.g., depreciation) and changes in working capital. |
|                         | Non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization) are added back to net income.                            | Depreciation of $10,000 is added back to net income.                                                       |
|                         | Changes in working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, accounts payable) are adjusted.                     | Increase in accounts receivable of $5,000 is subtracted from net income.                                   |
| **Balance Sheet**       | Changes in balance sheet items explain the differences between accrual-based net income and cash flow.     | Decrease in accounts payable of $3,000 is subtracted from net income.                                      |
|                         | The **beginning and ending cash balances** on the balance sheet match the cash flow statement.             | Beginning cash: 20,000;Endingcash:20,000;Endingcash:30,000 (reconciled on cash flow statement).            |
|                         | Changes in long-term assets and liabilities are reflected in the **investing** and **financing** sections. | Purchase of equipment for $15,000 is shown in investing activities.                                        |




The cash flow statement is divided into three sections:
1. **Operating Activities**:: Cash flows related to the company’s core business operations (e.g., revenue, expenses). <!--SR:!2025-07-03,1,250-->
2. **Investing Activities**:: Cash flows related to the purchase or sale of long-term assets (e.g., property, plant, equipment, investments).
3. **Financing Activities**:: Cash flows related to the company’s capital structure (e.g., issuing debt, repaying loans, paying dividends).


- **Land** is a **long-term asset** (part of property, plant, and equipment).    
- The sale of land involves the **disposal of a long-term asset**, which is classified as an **investing activity** on the cash flow statement.
- The cash received from the sale of land is reported in the **investing activities** section.

Issuing stocks would be classified as:
- A    investing cash flow.
- B   financing cash flow.
- C    operating cash flow.
?x
Issuing stocks involves raising capital by selling ownership shares in the company.
This activity is related to the company’s capital structure and is classified as a financing activity on the cash flow statement.
The cash received from issuing stocks is reported in the financing activities section.

Operating Activities:: Cash flows related to the company’s core business operations (e.g., revenue, expenses). <!--SR:!2025-02-10,1,250-->

Investing Activities:: Cash flows related to the purchase or sale of long-term assets (e.g., property, plant, equipment, investments).

Financing Activities:: Cash flows related to the company’s capital structure (e.g., issuing debt, repaying loans, issuing or repurchasing stock).

The conversion of face value USD500,000 convertible bond for USD500,000 of common stock would most likely be reported as: 
- A USD500,000 investing cash inflow and outflow. 
- B USD500,000 financing cash outflow and inflow. 
- C reported as supplementary information to cash flow statement.
?x
> Reported as supplmenetary information to cash flow statement
The conversion of convertible bonds into common stock is a non-cash transaction because no cash is exchanged.
Non-cash transactions are not reported in the cash flow statement but are instead disclosed as supplementary information to the cash flow statement.
Investing Activities: These involve cash flows related to the purchase or sale of long-term assets. The conversion of bonds into stock does not involve investing in assets.
Financing Activities: These involve cash flows related to the company’s capital structure (e.g., issuing debt, repaying loans, issuing or repurchasing stock). However, since no cash is exchanged in this transaction, it is not reported as a financing activity.

Which of the following can be presented using the indirect method under both IFRS and US GAAP? 
- A Cash flow from operations (CFO) 
- B Cash flow from investing (CFI) 
- C Cash flow from financing (CFF)
?x
- **Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)**: The indirect method starts with net income and adjusts for:
    - Non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization).
    - Changes in working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, accounts payable).
- This method is widely used because it reconciles net income (from the income statement) with cash generated from operations.
- The indirect method is a way of preparing the cash flow statement where net income is adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital to arrive at cash flow from operating activities.
Under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP, the indirect method is primarily used for presenting cash flow from operations (CFO).


Explain the differences between direct and indirect methods:

LO: describe the steps in the preparation of direct and indirect cash flow statements, including how cash flows can be computed using income statement and balance sheet data
?x
Cash Flow from Operations (CFO):
CFO can be computed using either the direct method or the indirect method.
Both methods arrive at the same cash flow from operations, but they use different approaches.
Direct Method:
	Converts each item from the income statement to its cash equivalent by removing the impact of accrual accounting.
Adjustments are made based on changes in balance sheet items (e.g., accounts receivable, accounts payable).
Indirect Method:
	Starts with net income and adjusts for non-cash items (e.g., depreciation, amortization) and changes in working capital (e.g., accounts receivable, accounts payable).


Using the following information (in USD millions), calculate a firm’s cash flow from operations (CFO).

| Net Income                           | 100 |
| ------------------------------------ | --- |
| Decrease in accounts receivable      | 21  |
| Depreciation                         | 30  |
| Increase in inventory                | 12  |
| Increase in accounts payable         | 9   |
| Decrease in wages payable            | 7   |
| Increase in deferred tax liabilities | 13  |
| Profit on sale of building           | 3   |

1. U.S. GAAP:
Interest Expense is classified as an operating activity.
Reason: Interest is considered a cost of financing the company’s operations, and U.S. GAAP requires it to be included in Cash Flow from Operations (CFO).

2. IFRS:
Interest Expense can be classified as either an operating activity or a financing activity.

Reason: IFRS allows companies to choose whether to classify interest paid as an operating or financing activity, depending on their preference and the nature of the business


LO: analyze and interpret both reported and common-size cash flow statements 

Operating cash flow 
• A healthy firm should generate positive cash flows from operating activities. (This is not applicable for startups). 
• Positive operating cash flow generated by liquidating non-cash working capital items (like liquidating inventory and receivables or increasing payables) is not sustainable. 
• Earnings that are significantly greater than operating cash flows indicate that aggressive accounting policies are being followed. 

Investing cash flow 
• Cash outflows can result from investments in property, plant and equipment, or other assets.
• Increasing outflows is an indication of growth.
• Decreasing outflows may indicate a reduction of capital expenditure and reduction in growth.

Financing cash flow 
• Tells us if the company is generating cash by issuing debt or equity. 
• Also tells us if the company is using cash to repay debt, reacquire stock, or pay dividends. Common-Size format 
• There are two approaches: 
	o In the first approach, we express each line item of cash inflow (outflow) as a percentage of total inflows (outflows). 
	o In the second approach, we express each line item as a percentage of revenue.
• Common-size cash flow statement makes it easier to identify trends in cash flows.
• It also helps us in forecasting future cash flows

In preparing a common-size cash flow statement, each item on the cash flow statement is expressed as percentage of:
- A    total assets.
- B    total revenue.
- C    total cash inflows.
?x
Total Revenue
In common-size analysis of a company’s cash flow statement, there are two alternative approaches. In the first approach, we express each line item of cash inflow (outflow) as a percentage of total inflows (outflows). In the second approach, we express each line item as a percentage of revenue. The common-size cash flow statement makes it easier to see trends in cash flow rather than just looking at the total amount. The second approach is useful for the analyst in forecasting future cash flows.

Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)::CAPEX represents cash outflows for the purchase or maintenance of long-term assets (e.g., property, plant, equipment).

Working Capital (WC) Expenditure::Working capital expenditure represents changes in current assets (e.g., inventory, accounts receivable) and current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) that affect cash flow.

Net Debt Repayment::Net debt repayment represents the amount of debt repaid by the company during the period, net of any new borrowings.

Cash Flow from Operations (CFO)::CFO represents the cash generated from the company’s core business operations, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital.
