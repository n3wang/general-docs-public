LO: Describe market efficiency and related concepts, including their importance to investment practitioners. 
![[Pasted image 20250201130153.png]]
?x
In an informationally efficient market, asset prices reflect new information **quickly and rationally**. ‘Quick’ is relative to the time a trader takes to execute an order. In an efficient market, it is not possible to **consistently achieve superior abnormal return**s. Prices should only react to unexpected information. In an efficient market, **passive investment strategy** is preferred overactive investment strategy.


LO: Contrast market value and intrinsic value. 
![[Pasted image 20250201130340.png]]

Market value is the price at which an asset can be bought or sold. Intrinsic value is the value based on complete information. In highly efficient markets, complete information is available in the market which is incorporated in the stock price. Therefore, market value = intrinsic value.


LO: Explain factors that affect a market’s efficiency. 
![[Pasted image 20250201130523.png]]
?x
• Market Participants 
• Information availability and financial disclosure 
• Limits to trading 
• Transaction costs • Information-acquisition costs


LO: Contrast weak-form, semi-strong-form, and strong-form market efficiency
![[Pasted image 20250201130541.png]]
- **Weak-Form Efficiency**: Prices reflect all **past market data**. No benefit can be gained by using historical price data or technical analysis.
- **Semi-Strong-Form Efficiency**: Prices reflect **past market data** and **public information**. Neither technical nor fundamental analysis can consistently achieve superior returns using publicly available information.
- **Strong-Form Efficiency**: Prices reflect **past market data**, **public information**, and **private information**. Even insider trading would not provide a consistent advantage.

Individuals investing in an inefficient market, will _most likely_ benefit from a(n):
- A  passive investment strategy.
- B  active or passive investment strategy.
- C  active investment strategy.
![[Pasted image 20250201130852.png]]
?x
C is correct. In an inefficient market, individuals might be able to earn abnormal profits as securities might be mispriced. On the other hand, in an efficient market a passive investment strategy would be preferred to an active strategy as there are fewer opportunities to earn abnormal profits.


Which of the following statements regarding a market’s efficiency is _least likely_ to be true?
- A  The greater the number of market participants, the higher would be the efficiency.
- B The greater the restrictions on arbitrage trades, the higher would be the efficiency.
- C The lower the costs of trading and information gathering, the higher would be the efficiency.
![[Pasted image 20250201131006.png]]
?x
B is correct. The greater the restrictions on arbitrage trading, the lower will be the **efficiency**. This is because arbitrageurs trade on the price differences between the same security or similar securities trading at different locations. Their trading minimizes the price differences across exchanges, making the markets more efficient.


Which of the following statements regarding different types of markets’ efficiency is least likely to be true?
![[Pasted image 20250201131347.png]]
A In weak-form of efficient markets, prices do not reflect all past price and volume information.
B In semi-strong-form of efficient markets, prices fully reflect all available public information.
C In strong-form of efficient markets, prices fully reflect all public and private information.
?x
Least Accurate: In a weak-form efficient market, past price and volume data are already reflected in prices. This statement incorrectly implies that prices do not reflect this information.


Bruce has a trading strategy that is based on buying undervalued securities using fundamental analysis to generate abnormal profits. If his trading strategy does make abnormal returns, the market is most likely:
A Weak-form efficient.
B Semi-strong-form efficient.
C Strong-form efficient.
![[Pasted image 20250201131637.png]]
?x
A. Weak-form efficient.
In a weak-form efficient market, past price and volume information is already priced in, but fundamental analysis can still provide a way to generate abnormal profits, as the market may not fully incorporate all publicly available information. <!--SR:!2025-02-09,4,270-->


LO: Describe selected market anomalies. 
![[Pasted image 20250201132427.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250201132450.png]]
?x
Time Series anomalies:
	• Calendar anomalies: The returns in January are higher than in any other month, especially for small firms. This phenomenon is known as the January effect.
	• Momentum and overreaction anomalies: Investors overreact to events or release of unexpected public information. 
Cross-sectional anomalies:
	 • Size effect: Small-cap stocks tend to perform better than large-cap stocks.
	  • Value effect: Value stocks tend to perform better than growth stocks. 
Other anomalies: 
	  • Closed-end fund discounts: Closed-End funds sell at a discount to NAV. 
	  • Earnings surprise: Investors can earn abnormal profits by buying stock of companies with positive earnings surprise and selling those with negative earnings surprise.
	  • IPOs: Prices rise on listing day, but underperform in the long term. 
	  • Predictability of returns based on prior information: Research has found that equity returns are related to prior information such as interest rates, inflation rates, stock volatility, and dividend yields.


LO: Describe behavioral finance and its potential relevance to understanding market anomalies. Behavioral finance examines if investors act rationally, how investor behavior affects financial markets, and how cognitive biases may result in anomalies.
![[Pasted image 20250201132627.png]]
?x
Some of the observed behaviors baises include: 
• **Loss aversion**: Traditional finance assumes that investors are risk averse. Behavioral finance suggests that humans are loss averse. 
• **Herding**: Herding is where one set of investors follows another set of investors for no rational reason. 
• **Overconfidence**: The overconfidence bias explains pricing anomalies. Overconfident investors do not process information. They place too much confidence in their ability to process and analyze information and, thus, value a security.


Which of the following statements regarding market anomalies is the _most_ _accurate?_
- A Neither weak-form nor semi-strong-form market efficiency holds.
- B Discovered anomalies are not violations of market efficiency, but a limitation of the research methodology.
- C Weak-form market efficiency holds but semi-strong-form doesn’t hold.
![[Pasted image 20250201133649.png]]
?x
B is correct. Discovered anomalies are not violations of market efficiency, but a limitation of the research methodology like inadequately adjusting for risk or data mining.


The behavioral bias under which an investor focuses on issues in isolation is most likely known as:
A Mental accounting.
B Narrow framing.
C Representativeness.
?x
Narrow framing.Narrow framing is where investors focus on issues in isolation. Representativeness is where investors assess new information and probabilities of outcomes based on similarity to the current state or to a familiar classification. In mental accounting, investors divide money into different buckets, they do not view their assets as a whole but allocate based on goals.
