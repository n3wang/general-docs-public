The basic features of a fixed-income security include the specification of: 
• Issuer: It is the entity that has issued the bond. The types of issuers include supranational organizations, sovereign governments, non-sovereign governments, quasi-government entities, and companies. 
• Maturity: It is the date on which the last payment is made for a bond. Based on maturity, bonds can be classified into money market security, capital market security, and perpetual bonds. 
• Par value: It is the amount an issuer agrees to pay the investor or bondholder on maturity date. A bond is premium if sold above par, discount if sold below par, and at par if sold at face value. 
• Coupon rate and frequency: Coupon rate is the interest rate paid on a bond every year by the issuer until its maturity date. Bonds that have only one payment at maturity are called zero-coupon bonds. 
• Seniority: Seniority ranking determines who gets paid first, or who has the first claim on the cash flows of the issuer, in the event of default/bankruptcy/restructuring.
• Contingency provisions: Some bonds may be issued with embedded call/put/conversion options.



An organization issued bonds of par value $1,000 and a coupon rate of 7.5%. The coupons are paid quarterly. The periodic interest payment is:
- A    USD75, paid once a year.
- B    USD37.5, paid twice a year.
- C   USD18.75, paid four times in a year.
