Reebh Reebh, CFA, is the CEO and founding partner of Lux Asset Management (Lux). Reebh provides asset management and allocation services for high-net-worth individuals and several small institutional clients. His services include investing client funds with third-party subadvisers who have a specialty in a particular asset class. Reebh’s clients are aware, and approve, of Lux’s allocation of their assets to subadvisers. The third-party subadvisers make payments to Lux based on the total value of a client’s assets placed or invested in the subadvisers’ funds. Reebh’s actions are 
A. appropriate because Reebh has disclosed the use of subadvisers.
B. inappropriate because the payments are an improper referral fee.
C. inappropriate unless Reebh discloses the financial arrangement he has with the subadvisers to his clients.

C is correct. Standard VI(A): Conflicts of Interest, Disclosure of Conflicts requires CFA Institute members and candidates to “make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or
interfere with respective duties to their clients.” The payments subadvisers make to Lux based on the value of the client assets Lux places with the subadvisers creates a potential conflict of interest because Reebh is thereby incentivized to hire subadvisers
who pay the fee but who might not necessarily be the best subadvisers for his clients.
