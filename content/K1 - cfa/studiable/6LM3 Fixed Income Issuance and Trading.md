Fixed income markets are often categorized along three dimensions: issuer type, credit quality and time to maturity. Sometimes they may also be categorized along additional features such as currency, geography, and ESG characteristics.
Fixed-income investors take positions across the credit and maturity spectrums in order to gain exposure to specific risks and match the cash flows of known future obligations. 
Pension funds and insurance companies with long investment time horizons prefer fixed-income instruments with fixed periodic coupon cash flows and a maturity profile that matches their long-term liabilities. Hedge funds and distressed debt funds may take additional credit risk at any point on the maturity spectrum to pursue higher expected return.


A fixed income security has an original maturity of 1 year and a credit rating of BBB. The most accurate description of the security is:
![[Pasted image 20250203080842.png]]
A money market security and junk bond.
B capital market security and investment grade.
C money market security and investment grade.
?x
C is correct. 
![[Pasted image 20250203080920.png]]A security with an original maturity of one year or less is a money market security. A security with a credit rating of BBB or higher is investment grade. A security with an original maturity of longer than one year is a capital market security.


A fixed income security has an original maturity of 1 year and a credit rating BB+. The _most accurate_ description of the security is:
![[Pasted image 20250203081134.png]]
- A money market security and junk bond.
- B    capital market security and investment grade.
- C    money market security and investment grade.
?x
A is correct. A security with an original maturity of one year or less is a money market security. Issuers rated BB+ (Ba1 on Moody’s scale) or lower are referred to as high yield, speculative grade, or junk. A security with an original maturity of longer than one year is a capital market security.

Like equity market indexes, fixed income indexes also track the returns of groups of securities that meet their inclusion criteria. Fixed income indexes can be used to evaluate market performance, benchmark the performance of investments and investment managers, and serve as the foundation for indexed investment strategies. Fixed-income indexes can be classified as broad-based, aggregate indexes with a vast number of constituents or narrower indexes that focus on criteria such as issuer type, credit quality, and time to maturity

LO: Compare primary and secondary fixed-income markets to equity markets.

Primary bond markets are markets in which bonds are sold for the first time by issuers to investors to raise capital. Bonds can be sold initially via a public offering or a private placement. Secondary bond markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors. After the initial offering, bonds are bought and sold among investors in the secondary market.


In which type of primary market transaction does an investment bank buy and resell the newly issued bonds to investors or dealers?
![[Pasted image 20250204195257.png]]
- A Single-price auction.
- B Best effort offering.
- C Underwritten offering.
?x
So, the correct answer is C: Underwritten offering. C is correct. In an underwritten offering the investment bank purchases all of the bond issue and resells it to the investors or dealers.



Which of the following statements is most likely to be correct regarding secondary fixed income markets?
A Secondary trading for listed fixed income markets primarily occurs on an electronic exchange.
B Retail investors are primary participants in these markets.
C The greater the bid-ask spread, the greater the bond’s illiquidity.

C: The greater the bid-ask spread, the greater the bond’s illiquidity.

A company wants to ensure that its entire bond issue is sold. The _most appropriate_ option for the company is:
- A    best effort offering.
- B    underwriting offering.
- C    shelf registrations.
![[Pasted image 20250204195358.png]]

B: underwriting offering.  In an underwriting offering, the investment bank buys the whole issue from the issuer and takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers. Contrary to an underwritten offering, in a best effort offering issue, the investment bank acts as a broker and only sells as many securities as it can instead of committing to sell 100% of the issue. The unsold bonds are returned to the issuer. The investment bank gets a commission for bonds sold at the offering price, faces less risk and has less incentive to sell the issue than in an underwritten offering. Best effort offering is usually preferred for riskier issues and corporate bonds. Shelf registration is a type of public offering where the issuer is not required to sell the entire issue at once. The issuer files a single document with regulators that describe a range of future issuances.
