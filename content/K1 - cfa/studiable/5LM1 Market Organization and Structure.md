Jacob invests in government securities with maturities of 1 month to 12 Months. His holdings are best described as:
A capital market instruments.
B money market instruments.
C cash market instruments.
?x
Money Market Instruments:
B is correct. Securities with maturity of one year or less are money market instruments. Securities that have more than one year maturity or equities that don’t have any maturity are capital market securities. C is incorrect because there is no such term.


Capital market instruments::: These are long-term financial instruments, typically with maturities greater than one year, such as stocks and bonds.

Cash market instruments::: This term is not commonly used in this context. The more appropriate term for short-term debt securities is "money market."

Money market instruments::: refer to short-term debt securities with maturities typically ranging from a few days to one year. These are low-risk, highly liquid instruments used for short-term borrowing and lending.

Which of the following are most likely help find counterparties for transactions ?
A Brokers.
B Dealers.
C Clearing house.
?x
Brokers


Brokers act as::: intermediaries between buyers and sellers. They facilitate transactions by finding counterparties (i.e., connecting buyers with sellers and vice versa). Brokers typically do not take on risk or hold inventory themselves; they earn a commission for bringing the two parties together.

Dealers::: also participate in transactions by buying and selling securities or other assets. Unlike brokers, dealers buy and sell from their own inventory, taking on risk and making a profit from the difference in the buy and sell price (the spread). While dealers facilitate transactions, they are primarily providing liquidity rather than specifically finding counterparties.

A clearing house::: is an intermediary between buyers and sellers after a transaction has been made. It helps settle and clear trades, ensuring that the transaction is properly completed. It reduces counterparty risk by guaranteeing the completion of trades, but it does not directly find counterparties.

LO: describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies 
?x
Net income from discontinued operations is shown net of tax after net income from continuing operations. 
Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP allow recognition of unusual or infrequent items. 
Changes in accounting policies can be adopted retrospectively (the financial statements for all fiscal years are presented as if the newly adopted accounting principle had been used throughout the period) or prospectively (only the financial statements for the period of change and for future periods are changed)


LO: Calculate and interpret the leverage ratio, the rate of return on a margin transaction, and the security price at which the investor would receive a margin call.
?x
Leverage ratio = Value of the position / value of the equity investment in it
Margin call price = P * (1 - Initial Margin) / (1 - Maintenance Margin)
The total return to the equity investment in a levered position considers:
Profit or loss on the position
- Margin interest paid
+ Dividends received
- Sales commission
To calculate the return percentage on a leveraged position, we need to divide the total profit by the initial investment..

LO: Compare execution, validity, and clearing instructions.
?x
**Execution Instructions** indicate how to fill orders. The most common execution orders are: 
	• Market Orders 
	• Limit Orders 
	• All-or-Nothing Orders 
	• Hidden Orders 
	• Iceberg Orders 
**Validity instructions** specify when an order should be executed. Different types of validity instructions include: 
	• Day orders 
	• Good-till-cancelled orders 
	• Immediate or cancel (fill or kill) orders 
	• Good-on-close (market-on-close) 
	• Stop orders (also called stop-loss orders)

LO: Define primary and secondary markets and explain how secondary markets support primary markets.
?x
Primary markets are where issuers first sell their securities to investors. The two major types of offerings are underwritten offering and best efforts offering.
	• IPO (Initial Public Offering) is where issuers sell securities to the public for the first time.
	• Seasoned or secondary offering is where an issuer sells additional units of a previously issued security.
Private placement is where corporations sell securities directly to a small group of qualified (sophisticated) investors as opposed to the public.
Secondary markets are where investors trade (buy/sell) in securities. The companies do not raise money from secondary markets. The cost of raising capital becomes low in primary markets when securities trade in liquid secondary markets.


LO: Describe how securities, contracts, and currencies are traded in quote-driven, order-driven, and brokered markets. 
?x
- **Quote-Driven Markets**: Customers trade at the price quoted by dealers. They are also called over-thecounter markets, price-driven or dealer markets. Dealers provide liquidity in these markets. 
- **Order-Driven Markets**: Trading is based on the rules to match buyers to sellers. In order-driven markets, traders supply liquidity to each other. Orders are matched using an order-matching system run by the trading system such as exchange, or broker. 
- **Brokered Markets**: Brokers arrange trades between customers; used for instruments that are unique or illiquid

|**Order Type**|**Explanation**|**When it Applies**|
|---|---|---|
|**Fill-or-Kill (FOK)**|An order that must be **filled immediately and completely** at the specified price or better. If it cannot be filled completely right away, it is **canceled**.|Used when a trader wants to make a transaction immediately or not at all.|
|**Good-on-Close (GOC)**|An order that is only valid until the **market closes**. It will be executed at the **close of the market** or cancelled.|Typically used for orders that need to be filled at the end of the trading day.|
|**Good-till-Cancelled (GTC)**|An order that remains active until it is either **filled** or manually **canceled**. It does not expire at the end of the trading day.|Ideal for long-term orders that can be executed at any time, without an expiration date.|
|**Market Order**|An order to **buy or sell** an asset immediately at the **best available price**. It guarantees execution but not price.|Used when the trader prioritizes **speed** over price, and wants to buy or sell immediately.|

|**Stop Order (Stop-Loss)**|An order to buy or sell once the price reaches a **specified level**, known as the stop price. Once the price hits that point, the order becomes a market order.|Used to limit losses or protect profits by automatically triggering a trade when a price level is reached.|
|**Stop-Limit Order**|Similar to a stop order, but once the stop price is triggered, the order becomes a **limit order** instead of a market order.|Used when the trader wants to limit the execution price after a specific stop level is reached.|

|**Reserve Order**|An order where the trader specifies the number of shares they wish to buy or sell, but only reveals part of it to the market.|Useful for large orders when the trader does not want to move the market with a large order size.|


ClearTech is a biotechnology research company that is planning to sell 5 million of its shares to the public. It has approached an investment banker who has guaranteed a price for the issuance. This transaction is _most likely_:
- A    Public sale of security in the primary capital market with the investment banker executing an underwritten offering.
- B    Public sale of security in the secondary capital market with the investment banker executing a best-efforts offering.
- C    Public sale of security in the secondary capital market with the investment banker executing an underwritten offering.
?x
A is correct. Since new securities are issued to public, they would be sold in the primary market. The investment banker guaranteeing a price for the issuance of security is a type of underwritten offering. In a best-effort offering, the investment banker acts only as a broker and makes no guarantees.


The primary market is where:: new securities (like shares or bonds) are sold for the first time. Companies issue new shares to raise capital.

The secondary market is where:: existing securities are traded between investors. The company itself doesn't receive any proceeds from these transactions.

In an **underwritten offering**,:: the investment banker guarantees a certain price for the securities. The investment banker buys the securities from the company and resells them to the public. The company is assured that it will receive the funds from the sale, and the investment banker assumes the risk if the shares can't be sold at the agreed-upon price.

In a **best-efforts offering**,:: the investment banker acts as a broker, but does not guarantee a price. The investment banker tries to sell the shares at the best price possible, but the company might not receive the full amount expected if demand is lower than anticipated.

Which of the following statements is _least_ accurate?
- A    In a quote-driven market, investors trade directly with the dealer that maintains inventories of assets.
- B    In order-driven markets, orders are executed using order matching and trade pricing rules – which are necessary because traders are usually anonymous.
- C    In call markets, trades occur at any time the market is open.
![[Pasted image 20250131210134.png]]
?x
In call markets, trades occur at any time the market is open.
. In call markets, orders are accumulated and securities trade only at specific times with prices set either by the auction process or by dealer bid-ask quotes.





LO: Describe characteristics of a well-functioning financial system.
![[Pasted image 20250131210441.png]]
?x
Four characteristics of a well-functioning financial system include:
• Well-developed markets trade instruments that help people solve their financial problems.
• Liquid markets with low cost of trading (operationally efficient markets) where commissions, bidask spreads and order price impacts are low.
• Timely and accurate financial disclosures that allow market participants to forecast the value of
securities (support informationally efficient markets).
• Prices that reflect fundamental values (informationally efficient markets).


LO: Describe objectives of market regulation.
![[Pasted image 20250131210427.png]]
?x
Markets are regulated to prevent fraud, control agency problems, promote fairness, set mutually
beneficial standards, prevent undercapitalized firms from exploiting their investors by making
excessively risky investments, and ensure that long-term liabilities are funded.


Country A has financial markets that have high costs of trading while Country B has financial markets where prices reflect underlying fundamentals quickly. The financial markets of both these countries are best characterized by:
![[Pasted image 20250131210626.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250131210755.png]]
?x
Option C.
Cost of trading determines the operational efficiency of a financial market. If a market has high cost of trading in terms of dealer’s commissions, bid-ask spreads and order price impacts, it is operationally inefficient. If the prices of securities reflect the underlying fundamentals, then the financial markets have informational efficiency.


Which of the following is least likely an objective of market regulation?
A Promote trading with as low as capital requirements to ensure greater market participation.
B Prevent trading on inside information.
C Protect unsophisticated investors.
![[Pasted image 20250131210951.png]]
?x
Option A ("Promote trading with as low as capital requirements to ensure greater market participation") is least likely to be an objective of market regulation. While market participation is important, capital requirements are typically set to ensure market stability and to protect investors, not to promote as low a capital requirement as possible.



Which of the following is _least likely_ a characteristic of a well-functioning financial system?
- A    High number of financially literate market participants.
- B    Well-developed markets trade instruments that help people solve their financial problems.
- C    Liquid markets with low cost of trading.
![[Pasted image 20250131211147.png]]
?x
Option A ("High number of financially literate market participants") is least likely a characteristic of a well-functioning financial system. While financial literacy is important, a well-functioning system does not require all participants to be highly literate. The other two characteristics (well-developed markets and liquidity with low costs) are more directly related to the system's functionality.
