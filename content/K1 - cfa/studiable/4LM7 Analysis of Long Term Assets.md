LO: compare the financial reporting of the following types of intangible assets: purchased, internally developed, and acquired in a business combination 
![[Pasted image 20250211020523.png]]
?x
Purchased intangible assets 
- The cost of a finite-lived intangible asset is amortized over its useful life.
- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. They are tested for impairment at least annually. 
Internally developed intangible assets
- Under IFRS, research costs are expensed but development costs may be capitalized.
- Under US GAAP, both research and development costs are expensed. (Except in the case of software created for sale to others.) 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination
- Acquired intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks are recorded at their fair value; similar to long-lived tangible assets.



Windemere Inc. starts an internal software development project on January 1, 2020. It incurs expenditures of $8,000 per month during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. By March 31, it is clear that the product will be developed successfully and will be used as intended. How are the software development costs recorded before and after March 31 according to IFRS?
![[Pasted image 20250211192525.png]]
- A USD24,000 (period from January 1 to March 31, 2020) is expensed and USD72,000 is capitalized (from April 1 to December 31, 2020).
- B Entire cost of USD96,000 would be capitalised.
- C Entire cost of USD96,000 would be expensed.
?x
USD24,000 (period from January 1 to March 31, 2020) is expensed and USD72,000 is capitalized (from April 1 to December 31, 2020).A is correct. Under IFRS all costs are expensed until feasibility is established if the software is developed for internal use. So, USD24,000 (period from January 1 to March 31, 2020) is expensed and USD72,000 is capitalized (from April 1 to December 31, 2020).
U.S GAAP: The entire cost of $96,000 should be capitalized.


Company A expenses assets purchased, while company B capitalizes them. All else equal, as compared to company B, company A will have:
![[Pasted image 20250211194250.png]]
- A   smoother earnings.
- B    higher asset turnover.
- C    lower cash flow from investing.
?x
Highest Asset Turnover. B is correct. Company A will have lower assets. Thus, asset turnover = revenue/average assets will be higher for company A.
x
Capitalizing:  In general, when a company acquires a long-lived tangible or intangible asset, its cost is capitalized if the asset is expected to provide economic benefits beyond a year. The company records an asset in an amount equal to the acquisition cost plus any other cost to get the asset ready for its intended use.
x
Capitalizing results in spreading the cost of acquiring an asset over a specified period of time instead of immediately expensing it. All other costs to make the asset ready for intended use are also capitalized. Capitalizing leads to higher profitability in the period when the asset is purchased. The effect of capitalizing an expenditure on the financial statements is summarized below:

> Effect on Capitalization on Financial Statements


On the statement of cash flows, the cost of an acquired intangible asset will most likely be classified as a(n):
![[Pasted image 20250211194315.png]]
- A   operating cash flow.
- B.  investing cash flow.
- C.  financing cash flow.
?x
investing cash flow.
 is correct. The cost of an acquired intangible asset is classified as an investing cash flow while the cost of an internally developed intangible asset is classified as an operating cash flow.

On the statement of cash flow, an internally developed intangible asset will most likely be classified as a:
![[Pasted image 20250211194717.png]]
A Operating cash flow.
B Investing cash flow.
C Financing cash flow.
?x
Operating cash flow.  A is correct. The cost of an internally developed intangible asset is classified as an operating cash flow while the cost of an acquired intangible asset is classified as an investing cash flow.

B: Investing Cash Flow.
The cost of an acquired intangible asset is classified as an investing cash flow because it involves the purchase of a long-term asset.

LO: explain and evaluate how impairment and derecognition of property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets affect the financial statements and ratios![[Pasted image 20250211212745.png]]![[Pasted image 20250211212757.png]]![[Pasted image 20250211212857.png]]?x
Impairment 
**Under IFRS**
• An asset is impaired when its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount.
• The recoverable amount is the greater of (fair value less selling costs) and the present (value of expected cash flows from the asset i.e. the value in use).
• If impaired, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount.
• Subsequent loss recoveries are allowed, but they cannot exceed the historical cost.
**Under US GAAP,**
• An asset is impaired if its carrying value is greater than the asset’s undiscounted future cash flows.
• If impaired, the asset is written down to the fair value.
• Subsequent loss recoveries are not allowed.
Impact on financial statements When an asset is impaired the impact in that period is: • The value of the asset is written down. • Activity ratios such as sales/assets are higher. 
• Income is lower due to impairment expense. 
• Therefore, profitability ratios are lower. 
• Cash flows are not impacted (ignoring taxes). 
The impact in subsequent periods is: 
• Higher income because of reduced depreciation expense. 
• Therefore, profitability ratios are higher. 
• Activity ratios such as sales/assets are higher
**Derecognition**
The three ways in which an asset can be derecognized (removed from a company’s financial statements) are:
• Selling the asset: The difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value of the asset is reported as a gain or loss on the income statement.
• Abandoning the asset: The carrying value of the asset is removed from the balance sheet and a loss is recognized in that amount in the income statement.
• Exchanging the asset: The carrying value of the old asset is compared to the fair value of the new asset and a gain or loss is reported.
• Distributed to owners in a spin-off: In a spin-off, typically, an entire cash generating unit of a company with all its assets is spun off and does not result in any gain or loss.
**Impact on financial statements**
• This can result in either a gain or loss on the income statement.
• A loss will lead to lower net income and assets.
• A gain will lead to higher net income and assets.


LO: analyze and interpret financial statement disclosures regarding property, plant, and equipment and intangible assets 
![[Pasted image 20250211213123.png]]
?x
An analyst can use financial statement disclosures to calculate the following: Average age = accumulated depreciation/ annual depreciation expense. Total useful life = historical cost/ annual depreciation expense. Remaining useful life = ending PP&E/ annual depreciation expense.


Which of the following assets will _most_ _likely_ be tested for impairment at least annually ?
![[Pasted image 20250211213237.png]]
- A Land.
- B A patent with a legal life of 20 years.
- C A trademark with an indefinite life.
?x
C is correct. Intangible assets with indefinite lives need to be tested for impairment at least annually. PP&E (including land) and intangibles with finite lives are only tested if there has been a significant change or other indication of impairment.




An analyst gathered the following information about a manufacturing equipment of XYZ, Inc.
![[Pasted image 20250211213523.png]]
The amount of impairment loss on XYZ’s income statement related to this equipment is closest to:
A USD26,000.
B USD34,000.
C USD38,000.
?x
C USD38,000.
![[Pasted image 20250211213800.png]]



Company A follows IFRS. Which of the following disclosures about property, plant and equipment would _least likely_ be found in its financial statements and footnotes ?
![[Pasted image 20250211213931.png]]
- A Acquisition dates.
- B Useful lives.
- C Disposal amounts.
?x
A is correct. IFRS do not require acquisition dates to be disclosed.
x
Under IFRS, for each class of property, plant, and equipment, a company must disclose the measurement bases, the depreciation method, the useful lives (or, equivalently, the depreciation rate) used, the gross carrying amount, the accumulated depreciation at the beginning and end of the period, and a reconciliation of the carrying amount at the beginning and end of the period.
x
Under U.S. GAAP, the requirements are less exhaustive. A company must disclose the depreciation expense for the period, the balances of major classes of depreciable assets, accumulated depreciation by major classes or in total, and a general description of the depreciation method(s) used in computing depreciation expense with respect to the major classes of depreciable assets.
