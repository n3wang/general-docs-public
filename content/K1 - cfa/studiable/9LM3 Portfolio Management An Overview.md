LO: Describe the portfolio approach to investing.
The **portfolio approach** to investing emphasizes evaluating individual investments by how they contribute to the **overall risk** and **return** of an investor's portfolio, rather than looking at each investment in isolation. The key concepts in this approach are **diversification** and **risk management**.
?x
The portfolio approach means evaluating individual investments by their contribution to the risk and return of an investor’s portfolio. 
Diversification helps investors reduce risk without compromising their expected rate of return. A simple measure of diversification risk is the diversification ratio. The lower the ratio, the better the diversification.
$$
Diversification ratio = Risk of equally weighted portfolio of n securities 
$$


LO: Describe the steps in the portfolio management process?x
?x
The planning phase involves understanding the investor’s needs, creating a strategy, selecting appropriate assets, and building a diversified portfolio.
The execution phase focuses on monitoring the portfolio's performance and making necessary adjustments to keep the portfolio on track.

LO: Describe types of investors and distinctive characteristics and needs of each
1. **Individual Investors**: The needs vary based on individual goals and willingness to take risk. The income needs depend on the investment rationale.

LO: Describe aspects of the asset management industry. 
![[Pasted image 20250208204429.png]]
?x
An asset management industry is an integral component of the global financial services sector. Asset managers are usually referred to as a buy-side firm as it uses (buys) the services of sell-side firms (broker/dealer that sells securities and provides independent investment research and recommendations to buy-side firms). 
- • Active asset managers attempt to outperform pre-determined performance benchmark. 
- • Passive asset managers attempt to match returns of a pre-determined benchmark.
- • Traditional asset managers focus on long-only equity, fixed-income, and multi-asset investment strategies. 
- • Alternative asset managers focus on hedge fund, private equity, and venture capital strategies, etc. 
- • The majority of asset management firms are privately owned and are structured as limited liability companies or limited partnerships. 
- • The three key trends in the asset management industry include growth of passive investing, “Big data” in the investment process, and robo-advisers in the wealth management industry

Which of the following financial products is _most likely_ to trade at their net asset value and _least likely_ to have capital gain distribution?
**Trades at net asset value**                         **Does not have capital gain distribution**
1. Open-end mutual funds                                Exchange traded funds
2. Exchange traded funds                                Closed-end mutual funds
3. Closed-end mutual funds                             Open-end mutual funds
X
- **Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)**: These trade like stocks on an exchange throughout the day at market prices, which can differ from NAV. ETFs may have capital gains distributions, but they are typically structured to minimize them by utilizing n-kind transfers.
- **Closed-end mutual funds**: These trade on exchanges at market prices, which can be higher or lower than NAV (i.e., they may trade at a premium or discount). They are more likely to have capital gains distributions because they do not have the flexibility to manage redemptions and inflows like open-end funds.
- **Open-end mutual funds**: These trade at **net asset value** and are less likely to have capital gain distributions due to the flexibility in managing investor transactions and maintaining a balanced portfolio.
?x
Open-end mutual funds
Open-end mutual funds trade at their net asset value per share, while closed-end mutual funds and exchange traded funds can trade at a premium or a discount to their net asset value.
Exchange traded funds do not have capital gain distributions as they are passively managed.


Which of the following is _least likely_ correct with respect to separately managed accounts:
- A    The minimum investment required to open a separately managed account (SMA) is higher than that of a mutual fund.
- B   In a separately managed account (SMA) transactions can be tailored to the specific needs of the investor.
- C  In a separately managed account (SMA), no tax implications are considered when buying or selling as it meets the specific needs of the investor.
![[Pasted image 20250208205135.png]]
?x
C. In a separately managed account (SMA), no tax implications are considered when buying or selling as it meets the specific needs of the investor.  In a separately managed account (SMA), tax implications are considered when buying or selling as it meets the specific needs of the investor. A and B are correct statements. The minimum investment required to open an SMA is usually much higher than that of a mutual fund since in a mutual fund the investor is invests any amount into a pool of investments, while in a SMA the portfolio belongs solely to the individual investor. In an SMA, transactions can be tailored to the specific needs of the investor.


The key trends in the asset management industry _most likely_ include:
![[Pasted image 20250208205430.png]]
- A   growth of traditional investing.
- B    growth of passive investing.
- C    growth of publicly traded asset management companies.
?x
B is correct. The three key trends in the asset management industry include growth of passive investing, “Big data” in the investment process, and robo-advisers in the wealth management industry.


LO: Describe mutual funds and compare them with other pooled investment products
![[Pasted image 20250208205856.png]]

?x
A mutual fund is a comingled investment pool in which each investor has a pro-rata claim on the income and value of the fund. In the context of mutual funds, it is important to understand the following terms: 
- **Net asset value:** Net asset value = value of assets – liabilities. The value of a mutual fund is called the net asset value. Open-end fund: A mutual fund with no restrictions on when new shares can be issued or when funds can be withdrawn. 
- **Closed-end fund:** Unlike an open-end fund, in a closed-end fund no new investment money is accepted.
- No-load fund: Only an annual fee is charged, but there is no fee for investment or redemption. 
- **Load fund**: A percentage is charged for investment or redemption or both, in addition to the annual fee. Funds can be categorized based on the types of investments (money market, bond mutual funds, stock mutual funds, index funds). Like mutual funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a pooled investment vehicle, often based on an index. With index mutual funds, investors buy shares directly from the fund. With ETFs, investors buy shares from other investors.

**ETFs combine features of closed-end and open-end funds.**
![[Pasted image 20250208210057.png]]
• Track NAV like open-end funds.
• Trade like close-end funds (continuously traded, can buy on margin, can short sell).
• Expenses are lower compared to mutual funds, but brokerage fee needs to be paid.
• Unlike mutual funds, ETFs do not have capital gains distributions.
**Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)**
![[Pasted image 20250208210116.png]]
• Also called “managed account”, “wrap account”, “individually managed account.”
• The investor owns individual (underlying) shares.
• Tax implications are considered when buying or selling.
• Requires high minimum investment.
Hedge Funds
• Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that typically use leverage, derivatives, and long and
short investment strategies.


Describe Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds 
![[Pasted image 20250208210259.png]]
?x
• Private Equity and Venture Capital Funds are privately held and actively managed equity positions. The equity they hold is private with the intention to exit out of the investment in a few years. Like majority of alternative funds, private equity and venture capital funds are structured as limited partnerships between the fund manager, called the general partner (GP), and the fund’s investors, called limited partners (LPs). The revenue of these funds comprises of management fee, transaction fee, carried interest and investment income.


Which of the following regarding venture capital fund and a hedge fund is _most likely_ correct?
- A    Both are structured as limited partnerships between the fund manager, called the general partner (GP), and the fund’s investors, called limited partners (LPs).
- B    Both have short investment horizon, typically three to five years.
- C    Both use leverage to increase their returns.
![[Pasted image 20250208220210.png]]
?x
**A** is the most likely correct statement, as both **venture capital** and **hedge funds** are structured as **limited partnerships**.


Which of the following is _least likely_ a characteristic of hedge funds?
- A    Short selling
- B    Leverage
- C    Risk seeking
?x

Characteristics of hedge funds:
Short selling: Many hedge funds use short-selling directly or synthetically using options, futures, and credit default swaps.
Absolute return seeking: Hedge funds seek an absolute, positive returns in all market environments.
Leverage: Most of the hedge funds use financial leverage (bank borrowing) or implicit leverage (using derivatives).
Low correlation: Some hedge funds tend to have low return correlations with traditional equity and/or fixed-income asset classes.
Fee structures: Hedge funds typically charge two distinct fees: a traditional asset-based management fee (AUM fee) and an incentive (or performance) fee.



Which of the following statements regarding private equity is _most accurate_?
- A    These are typically long-term investments.
- B    The firm that makes the investment is not involved with the management of the company.
- C    The revenue of these funds comprises of a management fee, transaction fees, carried interest and investment income.
?x
Tnue of these funds comprises of a management fee, transaction fees, carried interest and investment income.
C is correct. Private equity and venture capital funds are privately held and actively managed equity positions. In such funds, a firm makes an investment in a company and then is actively involved in the management of that company. The equity they hold is private and not traded in public markets. The intention is to exit out of the investment in a few years. Like majority of alternative funds, private equity and venture capital funds are structured as limited partnerships between the fund manager, called the general partner (GP), and the fund’s investors, called limited partners (LPs). The revenue of these funds comprises of:
management fee (fees based on committed capital or net asset value or invested capital Transaction fees Carried interest: GP’s share of profits (typically 20%)
Investment income. Profits generated on capital contributed to the fund by the GP.
