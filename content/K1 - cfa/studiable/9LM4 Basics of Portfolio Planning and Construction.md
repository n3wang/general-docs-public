The IPS is the starting point of the portfolio management process. Before constructing a portfolio or choosing assets for a client, it is important to understand the client’s objectives. How much risk is he willing to take, how much can he actually take, how much return does he expect from the portfolio, what are his current circumstances? It defines a plan for investment success given the client’s situation and requirements.



LO: Describe the major components of an IPS. The major components of an IPS are:

?x
• **Introduction**: Describes the investment objectives, circumstances, and state of the client. 
• **Statement of Purpose**: Covers the scope of the IPS. 
• **Statement of Duties and Responsibilities**: Applies to investment manager, client, and other parties involved.
**Procedures**: Methodologies to tackle various circumstances and updating the IPS.
• **Investment Objectives**: The desired rate of return and the amount of risk the client is willing to take.
• **Investment Constraints**: Liquidity, legal, taxes, time horizon, and other unique constraints.
• **Investment Guidelines**: Specify permitted asset classes, selection of asset classes, use of leverage, asset allocation, and rebalancing etc.
**• Evaluation of performance**: Specifies the benchmark portfolio to compare investment results with, the frequency of evaluation, and other related information.
• **Appendices**: Contain information on specific guidelines like permitted deviations, strategic asset allocation, rebalancing strategies, etc. 



LO: Describe risk and return objectives and how they may be developed for a client. 
Risk objective might be defined quantitatively. Quantitative risk objectives can be expressed in absolute or relative terms.

 • **Absolute risk objective example**: The portfolio should not suffer more than a 5% loss in any 12- month period. Practically, this could be stated as: with 95% probability, the portfolio should not lose more than 5% value in any 12-month period. The absolute risk measures are not related to market performance. They are expressed in terms of standard deviation, variance, or value at risk.
 **• Relative risk objective example**: Return should be within 4% of the S&P 500 index return. The risk objective is expressed relative to a benchmark. 
 Return objectives can be stated on an absolute or a relative basis. 
	 • Absolute: Absolute return is the return a portfolio must achieve over a certain period of time. 
	 • Relative: A relative return objective will be stated relative to a benchmark.


Which of the following is _least likely_ to be a reason for having a written investment policy statement?
![[Pasted image 20250208222352.png]]
- A    Having a written IPS ensures the client’s risk and return objectives can be achieved.
- B    The IPS may be required by regulation.
- C    Having a written IPS is part of the best practice for a portfolio manager.
?x
A is correct. A written IPS is consistent with best practices to be followed by a portfolio manager. Depending on the circumstances, a written IPS or its equivalent may be required by law. A written IPS however doesn’t ensure that risk and return objectives will in fact be achieved.
