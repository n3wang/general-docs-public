Index providers must consider the following: 
• Which target market should the index represent? E.g., U.S. Equities. • Which securities should be selected from that market? E.g., Large cap securities. 
• How much weight should be allocated to each security in the index? • When should the index be rebalanced? 
• When should the security selection and weighted decision be re-examined? 
Target market can be defined broadly or narrowly. It may also be based on asset class, geographic region, industries, sizes, exchange, and/or other characteristics



Catherine has gathered the following information on performance of an security index:
![[Pasted image 20250131221431.png]]
The value of the index at the start of the year is _closest_ to:
?x
Closest to 526.30
 Total return on an index uses both the price and income earned on the security to determine the overall return earned. Thus it measures the price appreciation, interest, and dividend income over a period, which is expressed as a percentage of the beginning value of the index.
Total Return = (Index valueend – Index valuestart +Income earned ) / index valuestart
4.5% = ( 500 – Index valuestart + 20 + 30 ) / index valuestart
Index valuestart = ( 500 + 20 + 30 ) / ( 1 + 4.5% ) = 526.31

Which of the following is _most likely_ true with regards to security market indices ?
- A    Once defined, the constituent securities are not changed.
- B    Security market indices measure the value of security markets only.
- C    Index values are calculated using estimated or actual values of constituent securities.
![[Pasted image 20250131222230.png]]
?x
C: Index values are calculated using estimated or actual values of constituent securities.
Correct: Index values are calculated using actual values of the constituent securities, based on real-time market prices. These prices can be adjusted for dividends, corporate actions, or splits. In cases where real-time prices are unavailable, estimated values might be used temporarily, but the standard calculation uses actual data.



The third major question to address when constructing an index is _most likely_:
- A    When should the index be rebalanced?
- B    Which securities should be selected from the target market?
- C    What weights should be allocated to each security in the index?
![[Pasted image 20250131222429.png]]

C What weights should be allocated to each security in the index?

LO: Compare the different weighting methods used in index construction.
Index weighting determines how much of each security to include in the index. This decision impacts index value. Various methods used to determine the weight of the securities in an index are:
- Price Weighting: The weight on each security is determined by dividing its price by the sum of all prices. 
- Equal Weighting: Assign equal weight to each constituent security at inception. 
- Market-Capitalization Weighting: Weight of each security is determined by dividing its market capitalization with total market capitalization. 
- Fundamental Weighting: Instead of using a stock’s price as a measure, fundamental weighting uses measures such as book value, cash flow, revenue, earnings, and dividends to calculate the weight of each security.

The market index that _most likely_ requires frequent rebalancing is:
- A    Price weighted.
- B    Equal weighted.
- C    Market-capitalization weighted.
?x
Equal weighted.
Correct
B is correct. After the initial construction of an equal-weighted index, the prices of constituent securities change and the index is no longer equally weighted. To bring the securities back in equal weights, frequent rebalancing has to be done to the index. Market-capitalization weighted indexes generally will have a momentum effect.



The index weighting method that most likely has a value tilt is:
A Equal weighting.
B Market-capitalization weighting.
C Fundamental weighting.
?x
C Fundamental Weighting
A value tilt means that an index will favor companies that appear undervalued according to fundamental metrics (like low price-to-earnings ratios or low price-to-book ratios). This tilt typically favors stocks that are considered value stocks—those with lower valuations relative to earnings, sales, or other fundamentals.


The index weighting method that most likely requires an adjustment to the divisor for stock splits and changes in composition of index is:
A Price-weighted index.
B Equal-weighted index.
C Fundamental-weighted index.
?x
A Price-weighted index.
A is correct. In a price-weighted index, the divisor is initially equal to the number of securities in the index. This divisor must be adjusted so the index value immediately after the split is the same as the value immediately prior to split.

David is trying to construct a price-return float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted equity index which includes the three stocks as shown below:
![[Pasted image 20250131225739.png]]
Assuming the beginning value of the float-adjusted market-capitalization weighted equity index is 100, the ending value is _closest_ to:
?x
132.1.

LO: Describe rebalancing and reconstitution of an index. 
![[Pasted image 20250201100433.png]]
?x
Rebalancing means adjusting the weights of an index’s constituent securities. The weight of each security in an index should reflect the weighting method used. The weights do not remain constant as the prices of securities change. Reconstitution is the process of changing the constituent securities in an index. It is part of the rebalancing cycle. The frequency of reconstitution varies from index to index.


LO: Describe uses of security market indexes.
![[Pasted image 20250201101125.png]]
?x
The most important use of indexes is that they give a sense for how a particular security market performed over a particular period. Indexes also serve as: 
• Indicators (gauges) of market sentiment. 
• Proxies for measuring and modeling returns, systematic risk, and risk adjusted performance. 
• Proxies for asset classes in asset allocation models. 
• Benchmarks to evaluate the performance of a portfolio. 
• Model portfolios for index funds and ETFs

LO: Describe types of equity indexes.
![[Pasted image 20250201101312.png]]
?x
Equity indexes can be classified into: broad market, multi-market, sector, and style indexes. 
The broad market index tries to represent the entire market. 
Typically, 90% of the securities of the selected market are represented in the index. The multi-market index includes indexes from different countries as they represent multiple security markets based on national markets, geographic region, development groups, etc. 
The sector index focuses on a specific economic sector such as consumer goods, finance, energy, health care, technology, etc., on a national or global basis. 
The style index contains securities based on certain characteristics like market capitalization, value, growth, or a combination of any of these. 
The market-capitalization index contains securities based on market capitalization such as large cap, mid cap and small cap. 
The value/growth index contains a group of stocks based on value/growth criteria.
The market-capitalization and value/growth index combine the three market capitalization groups with value/growth classification resulting in the following six basic index style categories: Large-cap value, large-cap growth, mid-cap value, mid-cap growth, small-cap value, small-cap growth.


LO: Describe types of fixed-income indexes
![[Pasted image 20250201101642.png]]
?x![[Pasted image 20250201101440.png]]

Which of the following is _least likely_ to be a use of an index ?
- A    Benchmarking performance of a mid-cap manager with a broad market index.
- B     Measuring market return, beta, and excess returns.
- C    As a reflection of market sentiment.
![[Pasted image 20250201101713.png]]
?x
A. Benchmarking performance of a mid-cap manager with a broad market index.
This is because broad market indexes (e.g., the S&P 500) include stocks of all market sizes (large, mid, small), whereas a mid-cap manager would be more accurately benchmarked against a mid-cap index like the Russell Midcap Index, which exclusively tracks mid-sized companies.

Which of the following statements regarding fixed-income indexes is _least likely_ to be accurate ?
- A    Fixed-income indexes have broader market and a higher turnover than equity indexes.
- B   Fixed-income indexes vary in their constituent securities and are difficult and expensive to replicate.
- C   Data for fixed-income securities is relatively easy to find.
![[Pasted image 20250201102232.png]]
?x
C. Data for fixed-income securities is relatively easy to find.
This is because fixed-income securities (especially in the corporate or municipal sectors) can be difficult to track, with limited or fragmented public data, making it harder to obtain reliable and up-to-date information compared to equities.

Which of the following statements regarding indexes representing alternative investments least likely to be true?
A In a hedge fund index, the constituents determine the hedge fund index rather than the index providers determining the constituents.
B Commodity indexes have issues because they have different weighting methodologies and are based on the performance of future contracts.
C Commodity indexes track the spot market performance and are subject to upward bias.
![[Pasted image 20250201112158.png]]

C Commodity indexes track the spot market performance and are subject to upward bias.



An index based that includes growth stocks is _most likely_ a type of:
- A   style index.
- B    broad market index.
- C    sector index.
![[Pasted image 20250201114412.png]]
?x
A. Style index.
This is because style indexes specifically categorize stocks based on investment styles, such as growth or value. A growth stock index is focused on representing the performance of growth stocks, which is exactly what a style index does.
