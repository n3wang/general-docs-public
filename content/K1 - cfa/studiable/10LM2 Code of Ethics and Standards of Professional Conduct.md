The Professional Conduct Program (PCP), in conjunction with the Disciplinary Review Committee (DRC), is responsible for enforcement of the Code and Standards. The CFA Institute Bylaws and Rules of Procedure for Professional Conduct form the basic structure for enforcing the Code and Standards. Professional Conduct inquiries can be prompted by: self-disclosure, written complaints and evidence of misconduct, and report by a CFA exam proctor.
	If the professional conduct staff believes a violation of the Code and Standards has occurred, sanctions are proposed. If the member/candidate does not accept the charges or the sanctions, the matter is referred to the DRC, which reviews materials and presentations from professional conduct staff and from the member or candidate. The DRC makes a final decision on whether there was a violation and if so what sanctions must be imposed.
