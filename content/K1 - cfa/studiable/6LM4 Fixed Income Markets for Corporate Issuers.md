A company wants to ensure that its entire bond issue is sold. The _most appropriate_ option for the company is:
- A    best effort offering.
- B    underwriting offering.
- C    shelf registrations.
![[Pasted image 20250204195358.png]]

B: underwriting offering.  In an underwriting offering, the investment bank buys the whole issue from the issuer and takes the risk of reselling it to investors or dealers. Contrary to an underwritten offering, in a best effort offering issue, the investment bank acts as a broker and only sells as many securities as it can instead of committing to sell 100% of the issue. The unsold bonds are returned to the issuer. The investment bank gets a commission for bonds sold at the offering price, faces less risk and has less incentive to sell the issue than in an underwritten offering. Best effort offering is usually preferred for riskier issues and corporate bonds. Shelf registration is a type of public offering where the issuer is not required to sell the entire issue at once. The issuer files a single document with regulators that describe a range of future issuances.

Revolving credit agreements are indeed the most reliable form of short-term borrowing, as they come with formal agreements and provide access to larger amounts of credit for multiple years. This offers greater flexibility and reliability compared to other options.
Uncommitted lines of credit are the least reliable because the bank can refuse to extend credit, making them quite unstable.
Committed lines of credit, while more reliable than uncommitted lines, are still less dependable than revolving credit, as they don’t offer the same level of long-term access or larger credit amounts.

LO: Contrast the long-term funding of i**nvestment-grade** versus **high-yield corporate issuers**.
![[Pasted image 20250204203023.png]]

?x
Because of its strong ability to meet promised interest and principal obligations from operating cash flows, an investment grade bond has a significant proportion of its YTM attributed to the government benchmark yield. Also, investors accept fewer or no restrictive covenants on the issuer. High-yield issuers are characterized by a higher expected likelihood of financial distress, with a greater proportion of a bond's YTM attributable to an issuer-specific spread over the benchmark yield. Given the high chance of default, these instruments are more equity like in nature. Therefore, investors generally impose more restrictions and covenants for HY issuers.
