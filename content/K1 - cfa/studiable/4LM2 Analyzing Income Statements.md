###### Analyzing Income Statements

Which of the following is _most likely_ an effect of capitalizing interest costs rather than expensing them?
A Lower net income in early periods
B Higher interest coverage ratio in early periods
C Higher EBIT in subsequent periods
?x
B: Higher Interest coverage
**Capitalizing interes**t means ==adding the interest cost== to the value of an asset (like a building under construction) rather than ==recording it as an immediate expense.==
Once the asset is complete, the capitalized interest becomes part of its ==depreciable cost== and is gradually expensed through depreciation in subsequent periods.
In contrast, **expensing interest** records the cost ==immediately== in the income statement, reducing net income in the same period.
Here’s how capitalizing interest costs affects financial statements:
Early periods:
Interest is NOT expensed immediately, so expenses are lower.
This leads to higher net income and higher EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) in early periods.
Higher EBIT also means the interest coverage ratio improves, because EBIT is in the numerator of the ratio.
Subsequent periods:
.
Depreciation will increase because the capitalized interest is included in the asset's cost.
Higher depreciation could lower EBIT and net income over time.

If an interest expenditure related to the construction of a building for a company’s own use is capitalized, the capitalized interest will _most likely_:
- A  be expensed later as part of the depreciation expense associated with that building.
- B  be expensed later as part of the interest expense.
- C be expensed later as part of cost of sales.
?x
-  A Be expensed later as part of the depreciation expense associated with that building.
-  If a company constructs a building for its own use, the associated interest costs, if capitalized, will appear on the balance sheet as part of a long-lived asset. Over time, this interest cost will be expensed as part of the depreciation expense associated with this building.

Company A expenses its software development costs. Company B capitalizes its software development costs. If an analyst is comparing the financial statements of the two companies, which adjustment to Company B’s financial statements are they _least likely_ to make?
- A
    Exclude amortization of prior years’ software development costs
- B
    Adjust the balance sheet to exclude capitalized software
- C
    Adjust the cash flow statement to decrease operating cash flows and increase cash used in investing by the amount of the current period development costs
?x
C: Adjust the **cash flow** statement to decrease operating cash flows and increase cash used in investing by the amount of the current period development costs
Company B has been categorizing the cash used on their software development as cash used in investing, whereas Company A has been treating it as an operating cash flow. To make the financial statements comparable, the analyst will decrease cash used in investing and decrease the operating cash flows by the amount of current period development costs on Company B’s statement of cash flows
..?
Company A expenses its software development costs. This means they treat these costs as regular expenses and immediately deduct them on the income statement.
Company B capitalizes its software development costs. This means they don’t treat these costs as immediate expenses. Instead, they record the costs as an asset on the balance sheet and gradually deduct the costs over time through amortization.
The issue? The two companies are accounting for the same type of costs in very different ways, which makes their financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement) not directly comparable.

### Lecture 6


LO: describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis of non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies 
?x
Net income from discontinued operations is shown net of tax after net income from continuing operations. Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP allow recognition of unusual or infrequent items. Changes in accounting policies can be adopted **retrospectively** (the financial statements for all fiscal years are presented as if the newly adopted accounting principle had been used throughout the period) or **prospectively** (only the financial statements for the period of change and for future periods are changed).
![[Pasted image 20250123194220.png]]
- **Discontinued operations** are shown separately, after tax, below the main income.
- **Unusual or infrequent items** are allowed to be reported separately under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP.
- **Changes in accounting policies** can be applied retroactively (redoing past statements) or prospectively (only affecting current and future statements).



An analyst is estimating the net profit margin of a manufacturing company for next year. The method he adopts is to average the net profit margin for the past five years. Which of the following statements is most likely accurate with respect to the items used for his projections?
A He must not include the gain on sale of investments, as it is a manufacturing firm.
B He uses the most recent year’s tax rate, which was only 60% of the previous two years’ rate.
C He must include the losses incurred due to discontinued operations in each of the five years.
?x
Net Profit Margin includes all income and expenses, including non-recurring items (like gains/losses from selling investments or discontinued operations).
For accurate projections, the analyst should focus on recurring, normal business activities and exclude one-time or unusual items that won’t happen again.
The tax rate used should reflect the company’s expected future tax rate, not just the most recent year’s rate if it’s unusual.
![[Pasted image 20250123194733.png]]



Which of the following is most likely correct regarding non-recurring items? 
- A Net income from discontinued operations is shown (as a separate line item on the income statement) before tax after net income from continuing operations. 
- B Unusual or infrequent items are shown as part of a company’s continuing operations. 
- C Unusual or infrequent items are shown as part of a company’s discontinuing operations.
?x
Unusual or infrequent items are shown as part of a company’s continuing operations.
![[Pasted image 20250123194958.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250123195031.png]]


A company has incurred a restructuring cost as a result of acquiring & integrating a new company. This cost will least likely be classified as:
- A unusual or infrequent item.
- B discontinued operations.
- C exceptional items.
?x
B discontinued operations.
![[Pasted image 20250123195236.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250123195215.png]]

What is Retrospective Restatement?
?x
Retrospective restatement means adjusting all prior period financial statements as if the new accounting policy had always been in place. This is done to ensure consistency and comparability across financial statements.

When is Retrospective Restatement Required?
?x
Retrospective restatement is generally required for voluntary changes in accounting policies or corrections of errors. However, there are exceptions where retrospective restatement is not allowed or not practical.

Retrospective restatement of all prior period financial statements is least likely required for a change from:
A FIFO to LIFO inventory valuation.
B zero salvage value to positive salvage value.
C capitalization of borrowing costs to expensing borrowing costs.
?x
> B zero salvage value to positive salvage value.
![[Pasted image 20250123213432.png]]


Prospective application is least _likely_ required for a change:

- **Prospective Application**::Applying a new accounting policy or estimate **from the current period onward** without adjusting prior financial statements. This is typically used for **changes in accounting estimates**.

- **Retrospective Application**:: Adjusting **all prior financial statements** as if the new accounting policy had always been in place. This is typically used for **changes in accounting policies**.
    
    
- **Change in Accounting Estimate**:: A revision of an estimate (e.g., useful life, salvage value, discount rates) based on new information or circumstances.


Prospective application is least likely required for a change:
A
in the useful life of a depreciable asset.
B
from one acceptable inventory costing method to another.
C
in discount rates used in computing the present value of the benefit obligations.
?x
B from one acceptable inventory costing method to another.

LO: describe how earnings per share is calculated and calculate and interpret a company’s basic and diluted earnings per share for companies with simple and complex capital structures including those with antidilutive securities
?x
![[Pasted image 20250123215251.png]]
> has a simple capital structure if it has no potentially dilutive securities (e.g., no convertible bonds, stock options, or warrants). In this case, only basic EPS is calculated.
- **Net Income**:: Total profit of the company.
- **Preferred Dividends**:: Dividends paid to preferred shareholders (subtracted because they are not available to common shareholders).
- **Weighted Average Number of Shares Outstanding**:: The average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, or share repurchases.
![[Pasted image 20250123215411.png]]
> has a **complex capital structure** if it has **potentially dilutive securities** (e.g., convertible bonds, stock options, or warrants). In this case, both **basic EPS** and **diluted EPS** are calculated.

 **Net Income**:: Total profit of the company.    
**Preferred Dividends**:: Dividends paid to preferred shareholders.
**After-Tax Interest on Convertible Debt**:: Interest expense on convertible debt is added back (net of tax) because the debt is assumed to be converted into shares.
**Convertible Preferred Dividends**:: Dividends on convertible preferred shares are added back because the shares are assumed to be converted into common shares.
**Weighted Average Shares**:: The average number of common shares outstanding.
**New Shares from Conversion of Dilutive Securities**:: Additional shares that would be issued if all dilutive securities (e.g., convertible bonds, stock options) were converted into common shares.
Antidilutive securities:: are securities that would **increase EPS** if converted (e.g., options with an exercise price higher than the market price). These are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because they do not reduce EPS.

Calculate Simple Capital Structure:
#formulas
Net Income = $1,000,000
Preferred Dividends = $100,000
Weighted Average Shares Outstanding = 200,000
?x

- After-Tax Interest on Convertible Debt = $50,000
- Convertible Preferred Dividends = $20,000
- Weighted Average Shares = 200,000
- New Shares from Conversion = 10,000

### Lecture 8


LO: evaluate a company’s financial performance using common-size income statements and financial ratios based on the income statement
- Common-size analysis of the income statement can be performed by stating each line item on the income statement as a percentage of revenue. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125113642.png]]
- Common-size statements facilitate comparison across time periods as well as across companies because the standardization of each line item removes the effect of size.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250125113706.png]]
	- Net profit margin is calculated as: Net Income / Sales. This indicates how much income a company was able to generate for each dollar of revenue.
	- Gross profit margin is calculated as: Gross Profit / Sales. Where gross profit is calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold.
	- Operating profit margin is calculated as: Operating Profit/ Sales. 
- Analysts can use these profit margins to compare over time and with industry peers.
	- Common-size income statements make it easy to compare financial performance over time and across companies by expressing each line item as a percentage of revenue.
	- Profitability ratios (gross profit margin, operating profit margin, net profit margin) help assess:: how efficiently a company generates profit from its revenue.
	- Analysts use these tools to evaluate trends and benchmark performance against industry peers

Income statements for two companies (A and B) and the common-sized income statement for the industry are provided below

| **All figures in $’000s**                     | **Company A** | **Company B** | **Industry** |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Sales                                         | 854           | 620           | 100%         |
| Cost of goods sold                            | 548           | 394           | 73%          |
| Selling, general, and administrative expenses | 213           | 143           | 12%          |
| Interest expense                              | 85            | 72            | 9%           |
| Pretax earnings                               | 8             | 11            | 6%           |

The _best_ conclusion an analyst can make is that:
- A   company B’s interest rate is lower than the industry average.
- B    both companies’ tax rates are lower than the industry average.
- C    company A earns a higher gross margin than both Company B and the industry.
?x
> B both companies’ tax rates are lower than the industry average.
![[Pasted image 20250125115803.png]]

LO: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to intangible assets 
?x
Intangible assets refer to identifiable non-monetary assets that lack physical substance. For each intangible asset, a company determines whether its useful life is finite or indefinite. 
-  An intangible asset with a finite useful life is amortized on a systematic basis over the best estimate of its useful life. The amortization and useful life estimate is reviewed at least annually. 
- The principles of impairment for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are the same as for property, plant and equipment (PP&E). 
- An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized. Instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually

Amortization:: Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortized (spread out) over their useful life. The amortization method should reflect the pattern in which the asset’s economic benefits are consumed.

Annual Review:: The amortization period and method must be reviewed at least annually. If there are changes in estimates (e.g., useful life), the amortization schedule is adjusted prospectively.

Impairment:: Intangible assets with a finite useful life are subject to impairment testing if there is an indication that the asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable. The impairment principles are the same as for property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).


No Amortization:: Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Instead, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

Impairment Testing:: The impairment test involves comparing the asset’s carrying value to its recoverable amount (the higher of fair value less costs to sell or value in use). If the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized.

LO: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to goodwill
?x
Goodwill arises when one company is purchased by another company. If the purchase price is greater than fair value at acquisition, then the excess amount is recognized as an asset on the acquirer’s balance
sheet and referred to as goodwill. Under both IFRS and U.S. GAAP, accounting goodwill is capitalized. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, it is tested for impairment at least annually.

The balance sheet is based upon which of the following equations?
A Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
B Assets = Liabilities – Equity.
C Assets = Equity – Liabilities.
?x
Assets: Resources owned by the company (e.g., cash, inventory, property).
Liabilities: Obligations or debts owed by the company (e.g., loans, accounts payable).
Equity:: The residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities (e.g., retained earnings, common stock).
It ensures that the balance sheet is always balanced. Every transaction affects at least two accounts, maintaining the equality of the equation.
It provides a snapshot of the company’s financial position at a specific point in time.


Current assets are those assets that are expected to be used up or converted to cash within one year or in one operating business cycle, whichever is greater.

A few examples of current assets are:

Cash and Cash Equivalents – Highly liquid, low-risk securities with maturity less than 90 days. They are reported at either fair value or amortized cost.
Accounts receivable – Amount owed to a company for goods and services sold. They are reported at net realizable value.
Inventories – Items held for sale or to be used for manufacturing. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value under IFRS, and at the lower of cost or market under U.S. GAAP.
Marketable securities – Liquid securities which are publically traded in market. For example, bonds and stocks.
Non-current assets include all assets that cannot be classified as current assets. Some common examples of non-current assets are discussed below:

1) Property, plant, and equipment (PPE) are tangible assets that are used in the company’s operations. They are expected to be used over more than one fiscal period. Examples of PPE include land, machinery, equipment, etc. PPE is measured differently under IFRS and US GAAP:

IFRS permits companies to report PPE using either a cost model or a revaluation model.
US GAAP permits only the cost model for reporting PPE.

Investment Property:: IFRS defines investment property as property that is not used in the regular operations of a company. Instead, it is used to earn rental income or capital appreciation. US GAAP has no separate definition for investment property. Similar to PPE, investment property is valued using either the cost model or the fair value model.

Intangible Assets:: These are long-term assets that lack physical substance. Examples include patents, licenses, and trademarks. IFRS allows companies to report intangible assets using either a cost model or a revaluation model. US GAAP allows only the cost model.

Goodwill:: Goodwill is an unidentifiable intangible asset. It is created when one company is purchased by another company. If the purchase price is greater than fair value at acquisition, then goodwill is created in the acquirer’s balance sheet. Under both IFRS and US GAAP, goodwill is capitalized (i.e., shown as an asset on the balance sheet). Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually. If goodwill is impaired, it is written down and the impairment loss is shown on the income statement.
- Goodwill is an **intangible asset** that arises when a company acquires another business for more than the fair value of its identifiable net assets.
- The formula to calculate goodwill is:
    
$$Goodwill=Purchase Price−Fair Value of Net AssetsGoodwill$$

Financial Assets: IFRS defines a financial instrument as a contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one company and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Financial assets include stocks and bonds, derivatives, loans and receivables. Financial assets can be measured either at fair value or amortized cost. The measurement basis depends on how financial asset is categorized. The major categories for financial assets are:

Held-to-Maturity:: These are debt securities acquired with the intent to hold them till maturity.

Held-for-Trading:: This category of asset is acquired primarily for the purpose of selling in the near term and is likely to be held for only a short period of time.

Available-for-sale: This category of asset is expected neither to be held till maturity nor traded in the near term.: The ‘available-for-sale’ classification no longer applies with the release of IFRS 9.

Financial assets include investment securities, derivatives, loans, and receivables. The following table summarizes measurement of different categories of financial assets:
![[Pasted image 20250125163224.png]]
1. Measured at Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVPL)
What it means: These assets are measured at their fair value (market value), and any changes in value (unrealized gains/losses) are reported directly on the income statement.
	Examples: Derivatives, trading securities.
	How to remember: Think of FVPL as "Fair Value = Profit/Loss" because gains/losses go straight to the income statement.
1. Measured at Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVOCI)
	1. What it means: These assets are measured at fair value, but the unrealized gains/losses are reported in other comprehensive income (OCI), not the income statement.
	2. Examples: Debt securities held for collection of contractual cash flows and selling.
2. How to remember: Think of FVOCI as "Fair Value = Other Comprehensive Income" because gains/losses go to OCI, not the income statement.
3. Measured at Cost or Amortized Cost
	1. What it means: These assets are measured at their historical cost or amortized cost (adjusted for interest or principal repayments). Unrealized gains/losses are not recorded anywhere.
	2. Examples: Loans, receivables, debt securities held to maturity.
	3. How to remember: Think of Cost/Amortized Cost as "No Fair Value, No Problem" because these assets are not revalued, and unrealized gains/losses are ignored.
![[Pasted image 20250125164049.png]]

Key Concept: Held-to-Maturity (HTM) Financial Assets
Definition: HTM assets are debt securities (e.g., bonds) that the company intends and has the ability to hold until maturity.
- Measurement: HTM assets are measured at amortized cost, not fair value. 
- Unrealized Gains/Losses: Since HTM assets are not measured at fair value, unrealized gains or losses (changes in fair value) are not recognized in the financial statements.

Which of the following assets is _least likely_ to be measured at cost or amortized cost?
- A Measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income.
- B Measured at Cost or Amortised Cost.
- C Equipment.


![[Pasted image 20250125165041.png]]
> So as you can see here all realized gains/losses reported in Income Statement


LO: explain the financial reporting and disclosures related to non-current liabilities 
?x
Long-term financial liabilities such as loans, notes and bond payables are reported at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 
Deferred tax liabilities arise from temporary timing difference between a company’s taxable income and reported income. They are defined as the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods due to temporary taxable differences.
