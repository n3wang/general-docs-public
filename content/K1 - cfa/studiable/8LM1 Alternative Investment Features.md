LO: Describe features and categories of alternative investments. 
![[Pasted image 20250204225318.png]]
?x
Traditional investments refer to long-only positions in stocks, bonds, and cash. All other investments are classified as alternative investments.
Alternative investments can be divided into three main categories: 
• Private capital – Includes private equity and private debt 
• Real assets – Includes real estate, infrastructure, natural resources and others 
• Hedge funds 
x
Features that distinguish alternative investments from traditional investments are: 
• Need for specialized knowledge: For example, within private equity, you have leveraged buyout and venture capital. There are managers who focus only on leveraged buyouts within private equity.
• Relatively low correlation with traditional investments. But correlation may increase during times of financial crisis.
• Illiquidity, long investment time horizons, and large capital outlays


Which of the following is _least likely_ to be considered an alternative investment?
- A   Private equity funds.
- B   Real estate.
- C    Long-only stock funds.

Infrastructure:
	• Investments in capital intensive, long-lived, real assets such as roads, dams, and schools, which are intended for public use and provide essential service.

Digital Assets: 
• An umbrella term that covers assets that can be created, stored, and transmitted electronically an have associated ownership or use rights. 
• E.g., cryptocurrencies and tokens. 
**Digital Assets**: These include cryptocurrencies and tokens that are created, stored, and transferred electronically. They offer a high-risk, high-reward investment option, often influenced by speculative interest and regulatory uncertainty. These assets provide exposure to new and innovative technologies like blockchain.
Hedge funds 
• They are private investment vehicles that manage portfolios of securities and derivative positions using a variety of strategies. 
• Some hedge funds aim for absolute returns independent of market performance
**Hedge Funds**: Hedge funds are private, actively managed investment vehicles that use complex strategies to generate returns. They are typically more aggressive than traditional investments and can be highly specialized. Hedge funds focus on absolute returns, making them an appealing option for accredited investors seeking diversification and potentially higher returns than the broader market.

LO: Compare direct investment, co-investment, and fund investment methods for alternative investments. 
![[Pasted image 20250205000106.png]]
?x
The three methods of investing in alternative investments are: 
	• Fund investing: The investor contributes capital to a fund, and the fund makes investments on the investors’ behalf, e.g., investments in a PE fund. 
	• Co-investing: The investor can make investments alongside a fund, e.g., investments in a portfolio company of a fund. 
	• Direct investing: The investor makes a direct investment in a company or project without the use of an intermediary, e.g., direct investments in infrastructure or real estate assets.

In comparison to other alternative investment approaches (co-investing and direct investing), fund investing is _most likely_ to:
![[Pasted image 20250205210958.png]]
- A be more expensive.
- B be subject to adverse selection bias.
- C have high minimum capital requirements.
?x
be more expensive.
A is correct. Fund investing is costly because the investor is required to pay management fees and performance fees that are typically higher than fees for traditional asset classes.
B is incorrect because co-investing is subject to adverse selection bias.
C is incorrect because minimum capital requirements will be high in case of direct investing


Which of the following investing methods _most likely_ requires more investment expertise and a higher level of financial sophistication?
![[Pasted image 20250205211632.png]]
- A Fund investing
- B Co-investing
- C Direct investing
?x
Direct Investing: Compared to fund investing and co-investing, direct investing requires more investment expertise and a higher level of financial sophistication resulting in higher internal investment costs


Which of the following investing methods is most restrictive in terms of exit from the investment?
![[Pasted image 20250205213953.png]]
A Direct investing
B Fund investing
C Co-investing
?x
B is correct. With fund investing, investors are less able to exit the investment as funds typically have lockups and other restrictions.



LO: Describe investment ownership and compensation structures commonly used in alternative investments.

The most common structure for many alternative investments is a partnership. It consists of two entities: General partner (GP) who is responsible for managing the fund and making investment decisions, and limited partners (LPs) who provide capital to the fund in return for a fractional partnership in the fund.
x
The general partner typically receives a management fee based on assets under management (commonly used for hedge funds) or committed capital (commonly used for private equity). Apart from the management fee, the GP also receives a performance fee (also called incentive fee or carried interest) based on realized profits. Generally, the performance fee is paid only if the returns exceed a
hurdle rate.


Which of the following is _least likely_ to be based on realized profits for a funds’ structure?
![[Pasted image 20250205214655.png]]
- A   Incentive fee.
- B    Management fee.
- C    Performance fee.
?x
B is correct. The management fee is based on assets under management. Management fee typically ranges from 1% to 2%.
x
Apart from the management fee, the GP also receives a performance fee (also called incentive fee or carried interest) based on realized profits. Performance fees are designed to reward GPs for good performance. A common fee structure is 2 and 20 which means 2% management fee and 20% performance fee.

Which of the following is the highest value used to calculate an incentive fee?
![[Pasted image 20250205214952.png]]
A high-water mark
B hurdle rate
C performance threshold
?x
A is correct. In some cases, the incentive fee is paid only if the fund has crossed the high-water mark. A high-water mark is the highest value net of fees (or the highest cumulative return) reported by the fund so far for each of its investors. This is to ensure investors do not pay twice for the same performance.


Which of the following statements is _least_ accurate about a waterfall structure?
![[Pasted image 20250205215235.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250205215908.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250205215921.png]]
- A   It defines the way in which cash distributions will be allocated between the GP and the LPs.
- B In most waterfalls, a GP receives a disproportionately larger share of the total profits relative to their initial investment.
- C uropean waterfalls are more advantageous for a GP as compared to American waterfalls as he can get paid before LPs.
?x
C is correct. Deal-by-deal (or American) waterfall is more advantageous for a GP as he can get paid before LPs receive both their initial investment and their preferred rate of return on the entire fund. Performance fees are collected on a per-deal basis.
In case of whole-of-fund (or European) waterfall, as deals are exited, all distributions go to the LPs first. The GP does not participate in any profits until the LPs receive their initial investment and the hurdle rate has been met.
