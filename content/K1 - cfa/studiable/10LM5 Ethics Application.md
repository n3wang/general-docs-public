Here I will have the ones that I did incorrectly


Mwangi, CFA, works for a firm that sells insurance products. Three of Mwangi’s clients purchase one type of product (Class A) but later change their minds and ask to switch to another, lower priced product (Class B). For Mwangi to complete the transaction, the law requires that she have her clients sign new sale and purchase documents for the Class B product. Given that not all the documents are ready for signing at the time of the clients’ request, Mwangi advises her clients to wait to sign until the complete set of documents has been prepared. When the full set of documents is ready, Mwangi tries unsuccessfully to reach her clients for their signatures. Because of the missing signatures, Mwangi’s manager threatens to cancel the exchange, which, because of other investment purchases, would place the clients’ accounts into an overdraft position. Under the firm’s policies, account shortfalls are covered by selling account assets once the shortfall has been outstanding for two weeks. To prevent this from happening, Mwangi signs the necessary documents on behalf of her clients. Mwangi’s actions are 
A. a violation of the CFA Institute Code and Standards. 
B. acceptable because her clients had already given their permission for the exchange to be made. 
C. acceptable if the clients gave Mwangi explicit permission to sign the documents on their behalf

A A is correct. This case involves Standard I(A): Professionalism, Knowledge of the Law, which requires CFA Institute members and candidates to “comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations . . . governing their professional activities.” To complete
the exchange from the Class A to the Class B product, Mwangi’s clients were legally required to sign the new sale and purchase documents, which did not happen. By signing the documents on behalf of the clients, Mwangi forged their signatures. This
violation of the law constitutes a violation of Standard I(A).



Hanse, CFA, is a portfolio manager employed by a global investment bank. She manages an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investment fund. In her free time, Hanse participates in civil disobedience demonstrations organized by the Extinction Rebellion, a sociopolitical movement that uses nonviolent resistance to protest climate breakdown, biodiversity loss, and ecological collapse. At several demonstrations held in the financial district, Hanse is arrested on charges of unlawful assembly, obstructing public transit, and disorderly conduct. She is ultimately convicted of several minor criminal offenses. Hanse has signed a standard employment contract with the bank that allows it to terminate any employee who is convicted of a criminal offense. Under the CFA Institute Code and Standards, Hanse’s actions 
- A. do not violate the Code and Standards. 
- B. violate the Code and Standards because she has violated her employment contract with the bank.
- . violate the Code and Standards because she is arrested for misconduct in the financial district.

A
A is correct. This case relates to what constitutes professional misconduct. Standard I(D): Professionalism, Misconduct prohibits CFA Institute members and candidates from engaging “in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit”
or from committing “any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.” Generally, Standard I(D) is not meant to cover legal transgressions resulting from acts of civil disobedience in support of personal beliefs
because such conduct does not reflect adversely on the member’s professional reputation, integrity, or competence.
