?x
Investors have different views of the market, which means the individual risky assets (e.g., securities) they choose to form their portfolio are different. This leads to different optimal risky portfolios, as illustrated in the figure below:
Indifference Curve: Each investor has a risk-aversion coefficient that defines how much risk they are willing to take on for a given return. If an investor is more risk-averse, they will choose a portfolio with a lower level of risk (perhaps closer to Portfolio A). Conversely, if they are less risk-averse, they may prefer a higher-risk portfolio like Portfolio C.
x
CAL: Each CAL corresponds to a specific risky portfolio (A, B, or C). The higher the risk associated with a portfolio (i.e., C), the higher the expected return. But the riskier the portfolio, the further to the right the CAL will go.
x
Portfolio Choice: The optimal portfolio for an investor is the point where their indifference curve is tangent to the CAL. This means they are maximizing their expected return for their level of risk.
x
1. Homogeneity of Expectations and Optimal Risky Portfolio:
Homogeneity of Expectations means that all investors have the same expectations about future returns, variances, and covariances of risky assets. In other words, they agree on which assets will perform well and which will not.
If there is homogeneity of expectations, there is a unique optimal risky portfolio for all investors. This is because all investors are selecting the same set of risky assets, just with different levels of risk exposure (different weights in their portfolios).
2. Efficient Frontier and Capital Allocation Line (CAL):
Efficient Frontier: The efficient frontier is a curve that shows the highest expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation). It represents the best possible portfolios of risky assets.
x
Capital Allocation Line (CAL): The CAL represents portfolios formed by combining the risky portfolio (the efficient frontier) with a risk-free asset. It shows the best possible risk-return trade-off for an investor, depending on their preference for risk.
x
The slope of the CAL represents the Sharpe ratio (which measures the return per unit of risk).
The CAL is drawn from the risk-free rate and is tangent to the efficient frontier (where the optimal risky portfolio lies).
3. Market Portfolio:
The market portfolio is the tangent point between the capital allocation line (CAL) and the efficient frontier.
This point represents the optimal risky portfolio where all investors (with the same expectations) will allocate their funds, combining it with the risk-free asset based on their individual risk preferences.

Jeff Thomas only invests in risky assets, while Lisa Jones invests in a combination of risky and the risk-free asset. Which of the following is _most_ accurate?
- A    At any given level of risk, the maximum return for both Jeff and Lisa would be denoted by the efficient frontier.
- B    At any given level of risk, Jeff’s maximum return is denoted by the CAL and Lisa’s maximum return is denoted by the efficient frontier.
- C    At any given level of risk, Jeff’s maximum return is denoted by the efficient frontier and Lisa’s maximum return is denoted by the CAL.
x
- **Jeff**: His **maximum return** for any given level of **risk** comes from the **efficient frontier**, as he only invests in **risky assets**.
- **Lisa**: Her **maximum return** for any level of **risk** is represented by the **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**, since she mixes both **risky assets** and a **risk-free asset**.

If the borrowing rate is higher than the lending rate:
- A    the slope of the borrowing segment of CML will be less than the slope of the lending segment of the CML.
- B the slope of the borrowing segment of CML will be equal to the slope of the lending segment of the CML.
- C the slope of the borrowing segment of CML will be greater than the slope of the lending segment of the CML.
![[Pasted image 20250207013302.png]]
?x
A is correct. The CML is divided into two parts: lending part and borrowing part. The point that divides the CML into the lending part and borrowing part is the market portfolio.
x
If the borrowing rate is higher than the risk-free rate, then the additional return for each additional unit of risk for the borrowing portfolio will be lower than the additional return for each additional unit of risk for the lending portfolio.
x
Hence, if the borrowing rate is higher than the risk-free rate, the slope of the borrowing segment will be lower than the lending segment.

LO: Explain systematic and nonsystematic risk, including why an investor should not expect to receive an additional return for bearing nonsystematic risk. 
![[Pasted image 20250207014108.png]]
?x
**Systematic Risk**: It is non-diversifiable or market risk that affects the entire economy and cannot be diversified away. Investors get a return for systematic risk. (Interest rates, inflation rates, natural disaster, political situation, etc.) 
.
**Nonsystematic Risk**: It is a local risk that affects only a particular asset or industry. There is no compensation for nonsystematic risk as it can be diversified away. (Oil discoveries, non-approval for a drug, new regulations for telecom industry, etc.)


**LO: Explain return-generating models (including the market model) and their uses.**
![[Pasted image 20250207014244.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207014313.png]]
?x
 Return-generating models provide an estimate of the expected return of a security given certain input parameters called factors. 
Multi-factor models include macroeconomic, fundamental, and statistical models. In a single-factor model, only one factor is considered. A classic single-factor model is the market model which is given by this equation: 
$$
R = α + βR + e
$$

LO: Calculate and interpret beta.
![[Pasted image 20250207015438.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207015727.png]]
?x
Beta is a measure of systematic (or market) risk. It is calculated using the following equation: 
![[Pasted image 20250207015355.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207015420.png]]
• β > 0: Return of the asset follows the market trend. 
	• β < 0: Return of the asset moves in an opposite direction to the market trend (negatively correlated with the market). 
	• β = 0: An asset’s return has no correlation with the market. For example, a risk-free asset has a beta of zero. 
	• β = 1: Beta of the market is equal to 1. If a stock has a beta of 1, it means it has the same volatility as that of the market.

Total risk is defined by the expected standard deviation.



Which of the following statements is _least likely_ correct?
- A    Non-systematic risk is also known as idiosyncratic risk.
- B    Investors are compensated for company-specific risk.
- C    Systematic risk is non-diversifiable.
- **Non-systematic risk** (idiosyncratic risk) can be diversified away, and therefore **investors are not compensated** for bearing it.
- **Systematic risk** is **non-diversifiable** and is the type of risk that investors are **compensated for**.

- **Analyst I**: A six-month Treasury bill (T-bill) has **no systematic risk**
    - Systematic risk refers to the risk inherent in the entire market or market segment, which cannot be diversified away. T-bills are considered risk-free in terms of default risk, and their return is typically not influenced by the overall market conditions. Therefore, they have no systematic risk.
- **Analyst II**: A six-month Treasury bill has **no non-systematic risk**.
    - Non-systematic risk is specific to a particular asset, such as a company's performance or sector risk. Since T-bills are issued by the government and are essentially risk-free in terms of default, they do not have non-systematic risk either.

Which of the following statements is _most likely_ to be correct ?
- A  The sum of an asset’s systematic variance and its nonsystematic variance of returns is equal to the asset’s total variance.
- B    The sum of an asset’s systematic standard deviation and its nonsystematic standard deviation of returns is equal to the asset’s total risk
- C    The sum of an asset’s systematic returns and its non systematic returns is equal to the asset’s beta.

Analyst I: A six-month Treasury bill has no systematic risk.
Analyst II: A six-month Treasury bill has no non-systematic risk.
Which of the analysts is _most likely_ correct?
- A. Analyst I only.
- B Analyst II only.
- C Both Analyst I and Analyst II.
Incorrect
C is correct. For a T-bill, we know how much an investor would get paid at the end of six months. The systematic risk and nonsystematic risk are both zero; the total variance is therefore zero.



Which of the following statements is _most likely_ to be correct ?
- A The sum of an asset’s systematic variance and its nonsystematic variance of returns is equal to the asset’s total variance.
- B  The sum of an asset’s systematic standard deviation and its nonsystematic standard deviation of returns is equal to the asset’s total risk
- C The sum of an asset’s systematic returns and its non systematic returns is equal to the asset’s beta.
![[Pasted image 20250208140603.png]]
?x
A is correct. The total variance of an asset is the sum of its systematic variance and its nonsystematic variance of returns. Both statements B and C are incorrect. Section 3. LO.c.

Which of the following statements about the Security Market Line is _least accurate_? The SML:
![[Pasted image 20250208144833.png]]
- A    does not allow us to identify mispriced securities.
- B    prices securities based only on non-diversifiable risk.
- C    slope equals the market risk premium
?x
A is correct. The security market line allows us to identify mispriced securities. The other two statements are true. The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model and applies to all securities, whether they are efficient or not. The graph has beta on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis.
SML intersects y-axis at the risk-free rate.
Slope of the line =   as β = 1 for the market. So, slope of the line is the market risk premium.
Statement B and C are true.

George Baker, a portfolio manager, earned a return of 15% on his portfolio over the past year. The market return over the same period was 8.5% and the risk-free rate was 2%. The portfolio had a beta of 0.75.

Jensen’s alpha for George’s portfolio is _closest_ to:
- A    6.5%.
- B    8.1%.
- C   6.9%.
![[Pasted image 20250208150240.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250208152943.png]]
Having Beta as the x and y for the alpha. You can see that the difference being risk free the positive, changes the slope, while the Portfolio return is an overal addedr.
?x
$$
R_p - (R_f + beta_p * (R_M - R_f))
$$
B is correct.
Jensen’s alpha =
Jensen’s alpha = 0.15 – [0.02 + 0.75(0.085 – 0.02)] = 0.081 or 8.1%.

Which of the following is not correct regarding portfolio performance appraisal measures?
![[Pasted image 20250208150611.png]]
- A    Sharpe ratio is the slope of the security market line and represents the reward-to-variability ratio.
- B    Treynor ratio is the excess return of the portfolio over the risk-free rate divided by the systematic risk of the portfolio.
- C.   The difference between the risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio and the performance of the market is called M2 alpha.
?x
A is correct.
Sharpe ratio is the slope of the capital allocation line and represents the reward-to-variability ratio.

Given that the expected market risk return is7% and the risk-free rate is 2.5%, what is the expected return for Daniel’s security?
- A 4.48%. 
- B 9.70%.

?x
- B 9.70%. 

LO: Describe and demonstrate applications of the CAPM and the SML.
?x
The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model and applies to all securities, whether they are efficient or not. The security is undervalued if it plots above the SML. The security is overvalued if it plots below the SML. The security is fairly priced if it plots on the SML.

Information about three stocks is provided below:
![[Pasted image 20250208174359.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250208174246.png]]
If the expected market return is 10% and the average risk-free rate is 2%, according to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and the security market line (SML), which of the three stocks is most likely undervalued?
A Stock ABC.
B Stock KLM.
C Stock XYZ.
?x
Stock XYZ
C is correct. Calculate the required return for the three stocks and compare them with the expected return to see which one is undervalued. For a stock to be undervalued (overvalued), its estimated return should be greater (less) than the required return (from CAPM).
x
For XYZ the required return = 2 + 1.5 x (10 – 2) = 14 -> required return < expected return of 16%, XYZ Corp. is undervalued. It lies above the SML.
x
For ABC the required return = 2 + 0.7 x (10 – 2) = 7.6 -> required return > expected return of 6%, ABC Corp. is overvalued. It lies below the SML.
x
For KLM the required return = 2 + 1.0 x (10 – 2) = 10 -> required return = expected return of 10%, ABC Corp. is fairly valued.

Which of the following statements about the Security Market Line is _least accurate_? The SML:
- A   does not allow us to identify mispriced securities.
- B    prices securities based only on non-diversifiable risk.
- C    slope equals the market risk premium.
?x
A is correct. The security market line allows us to identify mispriced securities. The other two statements are true. The security market line (SML) is a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model and applies to all securities, whether they are efficient or not. The graph has beta on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis.

SML intersects y – axis at the risk free rate.
Slpoe of the line = Rm – Rf /B = Rm – Rf as B = 1 for the market, So the slope of the line is the market risk premium.
Statement B and C are true.
