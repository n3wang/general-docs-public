LO: compare the financial reporting of the following types of intangible assets: purchased, internally developed, and acquired in a business combination Purchased intangible assets • The cost of a finite-lived intangible asset is amortized over its useful life. • Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized. They are tested for impairment at least annually. Internally developed intangible assets • Under IFRS, research costs are expensed but development costs may be capitalized. • Under US GAAP, both research and development costs are expensed. (Except in the case of software created for sale to others.) Intangible assets acquired in a business combination • Acquired intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks are recorded at their fair value; similar to long-lived tangible assets.


Long-lived assets may include:
- A    Fixed assets
- B    Patents and trademarks
- C    Both A and B
