LO: Describe the contents of a bond indenture and contrast affirmative and negative covenants.
![[Pasted image 20250201170801.png]]![[Pasted image 20250201171247.png]]
?x
Bond indenture is a legal agreement between the bond issuer and the investor. It includes all the terms of a bond issue such as the type of bond, its features such as principal value and coupon rate, and maturity date. It also includes the dollar amount of issue, issuer’s obligations, bondholders’ rights, when the coupon payments will be made, if the bonds are secured or not, covenants, and contingency provisions. 
Bond covenants are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time of a new bond issue. Covenants can be affirmative (positive) or negative (restrictive). 
- Affirmative covenants indicate what the issuer must do. These are generally administrative in nature. For example, issuer must make interest and principal payments on time, comply with laws and regulations, insure and maintain assets, etc. 
- Negative covenants indicate what the issuer must not do. These are frequently more costly and materially constrain the issuer’s potential business decisions. Examples include restriction on debt, negative pledges, restrictions on prior claims, restrictions on distribution to shareholders, etc.

A legal contract between a bond issuer and the bondholders, which defines the bond’s features, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders is _best_ described as a bond’s:
- A    covenant.
- B    indenture.
- C    debenture.
**Covenant** (A) refers to specific provisions within the indenture that dictate actions the issuer must or must not take.
**Debenture** (C) is a type of unsecured bond that is backed only by the issuer’s creditworthiness, not by specific assets.
?x
 A bond indenture or trust deed is a contract between a bond issuer and the bondholders, which defines the bond’s features, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders.

Which of the following is least likely a negative bond covenant?
A The issuer will not violate laws or regulations.
B The issuer is prohibited from investing in risky projects.
C The issuer will not sell assets that have been pledged as collateral.
![[Pasted image 20250201203046.png]]
?x
A. The issuer will not violate laws or regulations.
This is an affirmative covenant, not a negative one, because it specifies an action the issuer must take (complying with laws and regulations). Negative covenants focus on what the issuer cannot do, such as investing in risky projects or selling pledged assets.


ABC Inc. issued bonds 1.5 years ago with an original maturity of 2 years. XYZ Inc. issued bonds 3 months ago with an original maturity of 9 months. Currently, both these bonds have a remaining tenure of 6 months. The bonds would _most likely_ be classified as:
A money market securities.
B capital market securities.
C **ABC’s bonds are capital market securities** and XYZ’s bonds are money market securities.
**Money Market Securities**: These are short-term securities with a remaining maturity of one year or less. They are typically issued by governments, corporations, or financial institutions and are considered low risk.
x
**Capital Market Securities**: These are long-term securities with a remaining maturity of more than one year. These include bonds, stocks, and other long-term debt instruments.
?x
C is correct. A bond with an original maturity of more than one year it is called capital market security. A bond with an original maturity of one year or less is called money market security. 


A bullet bond has a maturity of 5 years, a par value of USD100, and a coupon rate of 7%. The principal repayment in the first year is _closest_ to:
- A    USD0.00.
- B    USD7.00.
- C    USD1.08.
**A bullet bond** is a type of bond where the entire principal (face value) is repaid at maturity and no principal is repaid during the life of the bond. The bondholder receives regular coupon payments, but the principal is paid in full at the end of the bond’s life.

A bullet bond has a maturity of 5 years, a par value of USD100, and a coupon rate of 7%. The principal repayment in the first year is closest to:
A USD0.00.
B USD7.00.
C USD1.08.
![[Pasted image 20250202180758.png]]


The structure that requires the smallest repayment of principal at maturity is that of a:
A fully amortized bond.
B bullet bond.
C partially amortized bond.
![[Pasted image 20250202180930.png]]
?x
Fully amortized bond
A is correct. In a fully amortized bond the principal is repaid over time. In a partially amortized a part of the principal is repaid over time and a part is paid at maturity as a balloon payment. Due to the balloon payment the principal repaid is more than the fully amortized bond. In a bullet bond the entire principal is repaid at maturity.

A company issued 10 year bonds with a notional principal of USD10 million. The payment structure of the issue states that the company will start repaying the principal from fifth year onwards. Each year the company will pay USD2 million. This is most likely a(n):
A balloon structure.
B amortizing loan.
C sinking fund provision.
![[Pasted image 20250202181141.png]]
?x
C. Sinking Fund Provision.
This structure is designed to reduce the debt over time, making it the most appropriate fit for the scenario.

LO: Describe common cash flow structures of fixed-income instruments and contrast cash flow contingency provisions that benefit issuers and investors. 
![[Pasted image 20250203071703.png]]

The different types of coupon payments are listed below: 
• Fixed periodic coupon: A fixed interest is paid either semi-annually or annually. 
• Floating rate notes: The coupon payments are not fixed; instead, they are linked to a benchmark reference rate such as Libor, short-term Treasury bills, etc. 
• Step-up bond: Can be a fixed-rate or floating-rate bond. The coupon rate increases over time. 
• Credit-linked Coupon Bonds: The coupon rate changes when the bond’s credit rating changes. 
• Payment-in-kind Coupon Bonds: The issuer pays interest by issuing additional bonds. 
• Deferred Coupon Bonds: Bonds that do not pay a coupon in the initial years, but compensate by paying a higher coupon in the later years. 
• Index-Linked Bonds: Coupon and/or principal payments are linked to an index. 
• TIPS: Treasury inflation-protected securities issued by the U.S. government; linked to the U.S.CP


A zero-coupon bond can _best_ be classified as a:
- A    step-up bond.
- B   credit-linked bond.
- C deferred coupon bond.
![[Pasted image 20250203072220.png]]
?x
deferred coupon bond.
C is correct. Since interest is effectively deferred until maturity, a zero-coupon bond can be thought of as a deferred coupon bond. A and B are incorrect because both step-up bonds and credit-linked bonds pay regular coupons. In a step-up bond, the coupon increases by specified margins at specified dates. In a credit- linked bond, the coupon changes when the bond’s credit rating changes.


Compared to a partially amortized bond, the first interest payment of an otherwise similar fully amortized bond are:
- A   lower or equal.
- B equal.
- C higher or equal.
![[Pasted image 20250203072344.png]]
?x
B.  equal.
. The first interest payment is the same for both repayment structures. This is because no principal repayment has been made by the time the first coupon is paid. Except at maturity, the principal repayments are higher for a fully amortized bond than for an otherwise similar partially amortized bond. Consequently, the principal amounts outstanding and, therefore, the amounts of interest payments are higher for a partially amortized bond than for a fully amortized bond, all else equal.


A bond that is characterized by a fixed nominal principal amount at maturity while coupon payment is linked to some index is best described as a:
A Capital indexed bond.
B Interest indexed bond.
C Deferred coupon bond.
![[Pasted image 20250203072803.png]]
?x
B Interest indexed bond.
B is correct.
Interest-indexed bonds: An index-linked coupon is paid during the bond’s life but nominal principal amount at maturity is fixed.
Capital-indexed bonds: Fixed coupon rate is paid but it is applied to a principal amount that increases in line with increases in the index during the bond’s life.
Bonds with deferred coupons: No coupons are paid in the initial years but higher coupons paid later.



LO: Describe common cash flow structures of fixed-income instruments and contrast cash flow contingency provisions that benefit issuers and investors.

A contingency provision is a clause in a legal document that allows for some action if the event or circumstance does occur. 
- Callable bond: It gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of the bond before the specified maturity date. Investors face reinvestment risk with callable bonds, as it is not possible to reinvest the proceeds at the previous higher interest rates. When a bond is redeemed early, the issuer has to make the lump-sum payment equal to the present value of future coupon payments and principal. The three types of callable bonds are American call, European call, and Bermuda-style call. 
- Putable bond: It gives the bondholder the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a pre-determined price on specified dates. Putable bonds offer a lower yield and sell at a higher price relative to otherwise non-putable bonds. Putable bonds are beneficial to the bondholder. The three types of putable bonds are American put, European put, and Bermuda-style put.

- Warrant: It is an attached option, not an embedded option. It gives the bondholder the right to buy the underlying common shares at a fixed price called the exercise price any time before the expiration date. 
- Contingent Convertible Bonds: These are bonds with contingent write-down provisions. The bonds can be converted into equity contingent to a specific condition.


Compared to an otherwise similar option-free bond, which of the following bonds will _most likely_ trade at a lower price?
![[Pasted image 20250203074053.png]]
- A    A putable bond.
- B    A callable bond.
- C    A convertible bond.
?x
B is correct. Put option and conversion option are benefits to the bondholders, therefore, they will be willing to pay a higher price. A call option is a benefit to the issuer, therefore bondholders demand a lower price.


Which of the following best describes a convertible bond’s conversion value?
A Price per share at which the bond may be converted to common stock.
B Par value divided by conversion price.
C Current share price multiplied by conversion ratio.
![[Pasted image 20250203074548.png]]
?x
C is correct. The conversion value of a bond is the current share price multiplied by the conversion ratio. A is conversion price. B is conversion ratio.


If a bond is callable only once on the call date, it is most likely a(n):
![[Pasted image 20250203074734.png]]
A American style callable bond.
B European style callable bond.
C Bermuda Style callable bond.
?x
B is correct. A European style callable bond can be called only once on the call date. A Bermuda style callable bond can be called on predetermined dates following the call protection period. An American style callable bond can be called any time after the call protection period.

A warrant is _least likely_ to be:
- A an attached option.
- B  an embedded option.
- C a yield enhancement.
![[Pasted image 20250203074941.png]]
?x
B is correct. A warrant is not an embedded option but rather an attached option. It gives the bondholder the right to buy the underlying common shares at a fixed price called the exercise price any time before the expiration date. Warrants are considered yield enhancements.
Explanation:
A: A warrant is an attached option, issued with another security like a bond, and gives the bondholder the right to buy common stock at a fixed price.
B: The warrant is not an embedded option because it is not part of another security. Instead, it is a separate instrument linked to the security.
C: Warrants are considered yield enhancements as they provide the holder with a potential to gain from stock price appreciation, thus enhancing the potential return.


LO: Describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the issuance and trading of fixed-income securities
![[Pasted image 20250203075349.png]]
?x
National Bond Market and Eurobonds: These two types of bonds are important because they highlight how bonds can be influenced by national versus international regulations. For example, Eurobonds are often issued in a way that minimizes regulatory burdens but offers flexibility in terms of currency denomination.
Legal and Regulatory Considerations: These affect how bonds are issued, with issuers needing to comply with local securities regulations, reporting requirements, and more. In the U.S., for example, bonds issued by companies must comply with the Securities Act of 1933.
Tax Considerations:
1. Interest Income Tax: Governments typically tax bond coupon income as ordinary income. This can make fixed-income securities less attractive compared to equities, which may qualify for more favorable tax treatment depending on the jurisdiction.
2. Capital Gains: Bonds held for more than one year may qualify for long-term capital gains treatment, which is often taxed at a lower rate. Short-term bond holders may be subject to regular income tax rates on their capital gains.
3. Discounted Bonds: The treatment of discounted bonds differs across countries. For instance, in the U.S., if a bond is purchased at a discount, a portion of the discount is considered interest income and taxed as such, even though the investor doesn’t receive that income in cash until maturity.

A bond issued by Samsung from South Korea, denominated in U.S. dollars but not registered with the SEC, and sold to an institutional investor in Europe, is most likely an example of a(n):
![[Pasted image 20250203075904.png]]
A Eurobond.
B global bond.
C foreign bond.
?x
A is correct. A Eurobond is a bond that is issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country. Thus, a bond issued by Samsung from South Korea, denominated in U.S. dollars, but not registered with the SEC, is an example of a Eurobond. Global bonds are bonds that are issued simultaneously in the Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market. C is incorrect because if Samsung’s bond issue were a foreign bond, it would be registered with the SEC. Foreign bonds are bonds issued by a foreign company but traded in the domestic market.



Which of the following statement is most likely correct ?
![[Pasted image 20250203080138.png]]
A Most Eurobonds are bearer bonds and ownership is recorded by name or serial number.
B Most Eurobonds are registered bonds and are subject to less regulation than domestic bonds.
C Most Eurobonds are bearer bonds and bearer bonds are preferred by investors for tax reasons.
?x
C Most Eurobonds are bearer bonds and bearer bonds are preferred by investors for tax reasons.
Most Eurobonds are bearer bonds. The trustee does not keep records of who owns the bonds; only the clearing system knows who the bond owners are. Eurobonds are issued internationally, outside the jurisdiction of any single country and are denoted in currency other than that of the countries in which they trade. They are subject to less regulation than domestic bonds. In the case of bearer bonds, the trustee does not maintain a record of who owns the bonds. That information is recorded in the clearing system. Investors prefer bearer bonds for tax reasons. In the case of registered bonds, records of who owns the bond is maintained using a name or serial number. Bonds in the national market tend to be registered bonds, while international bonds are usually bearer bonds.


George is an issuer of a 10 year bond. Which of the following provisions is most likely to be a benefit to him?
![[Pasted image 20250203080241.png]]
A Call provision.
B Conversion provision.
C Put provision.
?x
A is correct. A call provision is a benefit to the issuer as it gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of the bond before the specified maturity date.
A conversion provision is a benefit to the investor as it gives the investor the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of common shares in the issuing company. Therefore, B is incorrect.
A put provision is a benefit to the investor as it gives the investor the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a pre-determined price on specified dates. Therefore, C is also incorrect.
