?x
The return on real estate investments comes from income or asset appreciation or a combination of both. 
Real estate investments can be similar to bond investments in that they generate stable, predictable, lower-risk cash flows from leases that are comparable to bond coupon payments. Real estate investments are similar to equity investments in that they provide speculative returns based on the price appreciation of the real estate asset.
Real estate provides diversification benefits because of their low correlation with other asset classes. However, during steep market downturns, equity REIT correlations with market benchmarks can increase.

The assets underlying infrastructure investments are real, capital intensive, and long-lived. These assets are intended for public use, and they provide essential services. Infrastructure investments can be categorized based on:
• underlying assets as either economic or social
• stage of development of underlying assets as greenfield, brownfield, or secondary stage.
Infrastructure assets were primarily owned, financed, and operated by the government. Of late, they are financed privately through the use of public-private partnerships (PPPs).
