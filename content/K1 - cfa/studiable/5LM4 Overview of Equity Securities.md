LO: Describe characteristics of types of equity securities. 
![[Pasted image 20250201134334.png]]
?x
There are two types of equity securities: common shares and **preference shares**. 
**Common shares** represent an ownership interest in a company, including voting rights. In statutory voting, **each share** is entitled for one vote. In cumulative voting, a shareholder can cumulate his total votes and choose one particular candidate. 
**Preference shares** get precedence over common shares while claiming a company’s earnings in the form of dividends, and net assets upon liquidation. **Dividends on preference shares can be cumulative, noncumulative, participating, non-participating, or a combination of these**. Convertible preference shares are those that can be converted to **common stock**.


LO: Describe the differences in voting rights and other ownership characteristics among different equity classes.
![[Pasted image 20250201134726.png]]
?x
A firm can have different classes of equity shares, which may have different voting rights and priority in liquidation. For example: Class A shares would have more votes than Class B shares.


LO: Compare and contrast public and private equity securities.
**Public equity** is suitable for investors seeking liquidity and transparency with exposure to market-driven risks and rewards.
**Private equity** provides high return potential but comes with illiquidity, less transparency, and higher risks. It encompasses various investment strategies such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, and management buyouts, each catering to different stages of company growth.
?x
Private equity refers to the sale of equity capital to institutional investors via private placement. The types of private equity are: 
• Venture capital 
• Leveraged buyout 
• Management buyout 
• Private investment in public equity

There are two ways to invest in equity of companies outside the local market: direct investing and
depository receipts.
Direct Investment: Buy and sell securities directly in foreign markets in the company’s domestic
currency. 
Depository receipt: A security that trades like an ordinary share on a local exchange and represents an economic interest in a foreign company. Based on the foreign company’s involvement a DRs can be sponsored or unsponsored. Based on the geography of issuance, DRs can classified as • Global depository receipt (GDR) • American depository receipt (ADR) • Global registered shares (GRS) • Basket of listed depository receipts (BLDR)


Which of the following statements regarding the key characteristics of preference shares is _least accurate_?
- A     Preference shares combine the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.
- B    During liquidation, preference shareholders rank below subordinated bondholders with respect to claims on the company’s net assets.
- C    Dividends on preference shares are a contractual obligation and hence their price is less volatile than equity securities.
?x
**C. Dividends on preference shares are a contractual obligation and hence their price is less volatile than equity securities.**
This is incorrect because dividends on preference shares are generally **not a contractual obligation**, and their price can be **more volatile** than debt securities due to their discretionary nature and dependence on company performance.

When the shareholders receive only the pre-specified rate of dividend irrespective of performance of the Company, it is _most likely_ known as:
- A    Cumulative.
- B    Participating.
- C Non-participating.
![[Pasted image 20250201135552.png]]
?x
C is correct. In non-participating dividend, shareholders receive only the pre-specified rate even if the firm earns higher profits. The right to receive the standard preferred dividend plus an additional dividend based on some condition is known as a participating dividend. In cumulative dividend, if dividends are not paid out for year one and two, year three dividends would be sum of the third year’s dividends plus the non-paid out dividend of years one and two.



Which of the following is least accurate about private equity securities?
A Private equity firms have lower reporting costs compared to public companies.
B Private equity investments are liquid investments that offer greater potential for returns.
C Corporate governance and disclosures are weaker at a private firm.
![[Pasted image 20250201140408.png]]
?x
B. Private equity investments are liquid investments that offer greater potential for returns.
This is incorrect because private equity investments are generally illiquid and involve long holding periods. Although they may offer higher returns, they are not liquid like public market investments.

Which of the following statements regarding depository receipts is _least accurate_?
- A Foreign stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, and are denominated in U.S. dollars, are called American depository receipts.
- B Investors holding sponsored depository receipts have voting rights while investors holding unsponsored depository receipts do not.
- C   Global depository receipts are issued out of the U.S. and issuer’s country and are subject to capital flow restrictions.

C. Global depository receipts are issued out of the U.S. and issuer’s country and are subject to capital flow restrictions.



Which of the following statements regarding the key characteristics of preference shares is _least accurate_?
- A   Preference shares combine the characteristics of both debt and equity securities.
- B    During liquidation, preference shareholders rank below subordinated bondholders with respect to claims on the company’s net assets.
- C    Dividends on preference shares are a contractual obligation and hence their price is less volatile than equity securities.

C. Global depository receipts are issued out of the U.S. and issuer’s country and are subject to capital flow restrictions.
.
This is inaccurate because GDRs are issued in multiple markets globally and are not always subject to capital flow restrictions. The issuance process and potential restrictions depend on the specific market and regulatory conditions.



LO: Compare the risk and return characteristics of different types of equity securities: 
![[Pasted image 20250201143526.png]]
?x
Risk characteristics of different types of equity securities Common Shares 1. Returns are unknown as they can be from capital gains (price appreciation) and dividends. 2. On liquidation, common shareholders have residual claim, i.e., they get paid after claims of debt and preferred shares have been met; hence the amount to be received is unknown. 3. Foreign investments are subject to currency exposure risk. Preference Shares 1. Dividends on preference shares are fixed as a percentage of the par value. 2. Dividends are paid before common shares. 3. On liquidation, preference shareholders get par value of the shares. Common shares vs. preference shares. Preference shares are less risky. 1. Any unpaid dividends are accumulated and paid before common stock dividends are paid. Cumulative vs. noncumulative preference shares. Cumulative shares are less risky.

LO: Explain the role of equity securities in the financing of a company’s assets. 
![[Pasted image 20250201150245.png]]
?x
Companies issue equity in primary markets to raise capital and increase liquidity. A company needs capital to finance revenue-generating activities, make acquisitions, and provide stock-based and optionbased incentives to employees


LO: Contrast the market value and book value of equity securities.
![[Pasted image 20250201150527.png]]
?x
Book value is based on the current value of assets and liabilities (historic) whereas market value is based on what investors expect will happen in the future (intrinsic value). Book value and market value
of an equity are rarely equal. A useful ratio to compute and understand this relationship better is the price-to-book ratio (P/B).
![[Pasted image 20250201150608.png]]



Which of the following statements regarding the book value and market value of equity is _least accurate_?
- A The book value of an equity is the difference between the balance sheet value of the firm’s assets and liabilities.
- B  Positive retained earnings decrease the book value of an equity.
- C  The market value of an equity is the current price of shares multiplied by the number of outstanding shares.
![[Pasted image 20250201150720.png]]

Positive retained earnings decrease the book value of an equity.
Positive retained earnings decrease the book value of an equity.

Which of the following sources of increase in a firm’s ROE is the most favorable for an investor?
![[Pasted image 20250201151350.png]]
A Net income decreasing at a lower rate than book value of the equity.
B Net income increasing at a higher rate than book value of the equity.
C Debt is used to buy back some of the outstanding equity.
?x
B.  Net income increasing at a higher rate than book value of the equity.
Net income increasing at a higher rate than book value of an equity is generally favorable for an investor. Issuing debt to buy back an equity can increase ROE, but also increase the riskiness of the stock. Net income decreasing at a lower rate than the book value of the equity will increase the ROE. However, such an increase in ROE is not favorable as it signifies a contracting business.



When investors purchase company shares, their minimum required rate of return is most likely based on:
- A    the required rate of return of comparable companies.
- B    the minimum rate of return that will meet their individual financial needs.
- C    the future cash flows they expect to receive.
![[Pasted image 20250201151530.png]]
?x
the future cash flows they expect to receive.
C is correct. When investors purchase company shares, their minimum required rate of return is based on the future cash flows they expect to receive.
x
Cost of equity is the minimum expected rate of return that a company must offer its investors to purchase its shares (not easily determined).
x
- The cost of equity may be different from the investors’ required rate of return.
- Because companies try to raise capital at the lowest possible cost, the cost of equity is often used as a proxy for the investors’ minimum required rate of return.
- If the expected rate of return is not maintained, the share price falls.
Cost of equity can be estimated using methods such as the dividend discount model (DDM) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). These models are discussed in detail in other readings.
