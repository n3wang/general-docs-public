LO: describe the measurement of inventory at the lower of cost and net realisable value and its implications for financial statements and ratios
?x
**Net realizable value**: It is calculated as estimated selling price under ordinary business conditions minus estimated costs necessary to get the inventory in condition for sale. Net realizable value = estimated sales price – estimated selling costs Market value: It is the current replacement cost subject to lower or upper limits. 
-**Market value** has upper limit of net realizable value and lower limit of NRV less a normal profit margin. 
- Market value limits = (NRV - normal profit margin, NRV) Under IFRS, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
- Inventory write-ups are allowed but only to the extent a previous write-down to net realizable value was recorded. Under US GAAP, inventories are valued at lower of cost or market. If cost exceeds market, inventory is written down. No subsequent write-ups are allowed.

The balance sheet inventory values will reflect the most recent costs, if a company accounts for inventory using the:
A FIFO method.
B LIFO method.
C weighted average cost method.
?x
FIFO method.
- **Assumption**: The oldest inventory items are sold first.
- **Balance Sheet Impact**: The **remaining inventory** on the balance sheet reflects the **most recent costs** because the older, cheaper costs are assigned to COGS.
- **Example**: If the oldest units cost 10andthenewestunitscost10andthenewestunitscost15, the balance sheet will show inventory valued at $15 per unit.

Company A accounts for inventory using the LIFO method. During the current period, it reported a COGS of USD40,000 and an ending inventory of USD15,000. Its LIFO reserve decreased from USD5,000 to USD4,000 over the period. If the firm had reported using FIFO, its COGS would have been:

41000

0.1 Lower
Under IFRS, the inventory would be written down to its net realizable value (USD1.4 million), whereas under U.S. GAAP, market is defined as current replacement cost and hence would be written down to its current replacement cost (USD1.3 million). The smaller write down under IFRS will reduce the amount charged to the cost of goods sold, as compared with U.S. GAAP, and result in a lower cost of goods sold of USD0.1 million.
- Net realizable value: Estimated selling price under ordinary business conditions minus estimated costs necessary to get the inventory in condition for sale. NRV is from a seller’s perspective.
- Net realizable value = estimated sales price – estimated selling costs
- Market value: Current replacement cost subject to lower or upper limits. Market value has upper limit of net realizable value and lower limit of NRV less a normal profit margin. Market value is from a buyer’s perspective.

Company A adheres to US GAAP, whereas company B adheres to IFRS. It is most likely that:
- A company A has reversed an inventory write-down.
- B company B has reversed an inventory write-down.
- C both companies use the LIFO inventory accounting method.

Company A adheres to US GAAP, whereas company B adheres to IFRS. It is most likely that:
- A company A has reversed an inventory write-down.
- B company B has reversed an inventory write-down.
- C both companies use the LIFO inventory accounting method.
?x
B company B has reversed an inventory write-down.

LO: calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs affect the financial statements and ratios of companies that use different inventory valuation methods
?x
The following table compares LIFO and FIFO when prices are rising and inventory levels are stable. (We get the opposite effect during periods of falling prices)
![[Pasted image 20250125212011.png]]


**COGS** stands for **Cost of Goods Sold**:: It represents the direct costs associated with the production or purchase of the goods that a company sells during a specific period. This includes costs like raw materials, labor, and other expenses directly tied to manufacturing or acquiring the products that are sold.

Company A uses the FIFO method, and company B uses the LIFO method. Assuming stable inventory quantities, during periods of rising prices, the cost of goods sold reported by:
A company A would be higher.
B company B would be higher.
C both companies will be the same.
?x
company B would be higher.
![[Pasted image 20250126130939.png]]

Company A operates in an environment of falling prices. Its reported profits will tend to be the highest if it accounts for inventory using the:
- A  FIFO method.
- B   LIFO method.
- C   weighted average method.
?x
In a falling price environment, Company A would report the highest profits if it uses the LIFO method, since it will sell the cheaper, newer inventory first, leading to lower COGS and higher profits.

During periods of rising prices, a LIFO liquidation will:
- A    reduce cost of goods sold.
- B    reduce gross margins.
- C    increase LIFO reserve.
?x
A reduce cost of goods sold.
When a LIFO liquidation occurs, older and lower cost inventory is included in the cost of goods sold. Thus, the cost of goods sold decreases.
	Under First In, First Out:
Oldest goods purchased or manufactured are assumed to be sold first.
Newest goods purchased or manufactured remain in ending inventory.
When prices are increasing or stable, cost assigned to items in inventory is higher than the cost of items sold.
Advantage of using FIFO is that it is less subject to manipulation. It results in higher income when prices are increasing.

During periods of rising prices and stable inventory levels, a company using the LIFO method rather than the FIFO method will most likely report a lower:
A COGS
B Cashflow (after tax).
C Net income.
?x
> Net income.

A company values its ending inventory using the costs of its recent purchases. Which of the following inventory valuation methods is the company most likely using ?
A FIFO
B LIFO
C Specific Identification
?x
FIFO
 Under FIFO, the costs of most recent purchases are allotted to ending inventory. In LIFO, oldest goods purchased (or manufactured), including beginning inventory, remain in ending inventory. In specific identification method, the cost of sales and the cost of ending inventory reflect the actual costs incurred to purchase (or manufacture) the items specifically identified as sold and the items specifically identified as remaining in inventory.

Amerco Inc. uses the LIFO method and Britco Ltd. uses the FIFO method. During periods of falling prices, compared to the cost of replacing of the inventory, the cost of goods sold reported by:
- A  Britco is too high.
- B  Amerco is too high.
- C Amerco is too low.
?x
Britco is too high.
A is correct. Britco uses FIFO which means that cost of goods sold reflects old prices. Given that prices are falling, old prices are higher than the current cost of replacing inventory.


Company A uses LIFO method, company B uses FIFO method. During a period of rising prices, as compared to company B, company A will most likely have a higher:
A current ratio.
B gross margin.
C inventory turnover.
?x
c Inventory turnover
 During a period of rising prices, ending inventory under LIFO will be lower than that of FIFO and cost of goods sold higher; therefore, inventory turnover (COGS/average inventory) will be higher.

Compared to the industry average, a company has a high inventory turnover and lower sales growth. The company is most likely:
A managing its inventory efficiently.
B losing sales by not carrying enough inventory.
C has slow moving or obsolete inventory.
?x
losing sales by not carrying enough inventory.
Inventory turnover measures how quickly a company sells and replaces its inventory. A high inventory turnover suggests that the company is selling inventory quickly relative to its stock levels.


Create a table of the ratios for Inventory Turnover, Days of Inventory, Gross Profit Margin, Returns on Assets
?x
![[Pasted image 20250126144300.png]]

Which of the following ratios is least likely to be used to evaluate the efficiency or effectiveness of inventory management ?
A Days of inventory on hand.
B Gross profit margin.
C Quick ratio.
?x
Quick Ratio, The quick ratio does not take into account inventory and is least likely to be used to evaluate inventory management. The three important ratios used to evaluate the efficiency or effectiveness of inventory management include inventory turnover, days of inventory on hand, and gross profit.


A high inventory turnover ratio and low number of days of inventory on hand indicates:
A effective inventory management.
B inadequate amount of inventory.
C Obsolete inventory.
?x
A) Effective inventory management.
This is because the combination of high inventory turnover and low days of inventory on hand indicates that the company is efficiently managing its inventory, selling it quickly, and keeping stock at optimal levels.

Which ratio is most likely higher for a company using LIFO method to account for inventory, during a period of rising prices, when compared against a company using FIFO method?
A Current ratio.
B Gross margin.
C Inventory turnover.
