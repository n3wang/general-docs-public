LO: Describe the performance appraisal of alternative investments.
![[Pasted image 20250205222034.png]]
Alternative investments differ from traditional asset classes in the following ways: 
?x
• Longer time horizons 
• Unique patterns of cash flows 
• The use of leverage 
• Illiquid positions 
• More complex fee structures 
• Different tax and accounting treatment 
• Less normally distributed returns

Life cycle phases of various alternative investments generally fall into three distinct periods: 
- Capital commitment: In this phase, managers identify and select appropriate investments with either an immediate or a delayed commitment of capital (known as a capital call). Returns are typically negative during this phase. 
- Capital deployment: In this phase, managers deploy funds to: 
	- • construct or make property improvements (in case of real estate or infrastructure fund) 
	- • incur expenses in the turnaround of a mature company (in case of private equity) 
	- • initiate operations for a startup (in case of a venture capital) 
- Cash outflows typically exceed cash inflows. Management fees further reduce returns. 
- Capital distribution: If the property improvements/turnaround strategy/ or startup phase is successful, the underlying assets will appreciate in price and/or generate income exceeding costs. The fund can realize substantial capital gains from liquidating or exiting its investments.

Which of the following is most likely the case in capital deployment phase of the investment?
![[Pasted image 20250205223803.png]]
?x
A Cash outflows typically exceed cash inflows. 
B Management fees does not impact returns.
C Cash inflows typically exceed cash outflows.


Unlike public debt or equity securities purchased in the primary or secondary market, alternative investments usually involve:
![[Pasted image 20250205224138.png]]
- A  more normally distributed returns.
- B longer time horizons.
- C simpler fee structures.
?x
B is correct. Alternative investments usually involve a longer investment life cycle with distinct phases characterized by net cash outflows and inflows that complicate periodic return comparisons.


In the capital commitment phase:
![[Pasted image 20250205224338.png]]
- A    managers use funds to construct or make property improvements.
- B    managers identify and select appropriate investments with immediate commitment of capital only.
- C    returns are usually negative.
?x
C is correct. Returns are typically negative during the capital commitment phase because fees and expenses are incurred immediately prior to capital deployment, and assets may generate little or no income during this period.
x
A is not correct because managers use funds to construct or make property improvements in the capital deployment phase.
x
B is not correct because managers identify and select appropriate investments with either an immediate or a delayed commitment of capital in the capital commitment phase.

It can be difficult to conduct performance appraisal on alternative investments because these investments have asymmetric risk–return profiles, limited portfolio transparency, illiquidity, product complexity, and complex fee structures.

The IRR and MOIC calculations are frequently used to evaluate private equity investments.
x
The cap rate is frequently used to evaluate real estate investments. Leverage, illiquidity and redemption pressure pose special challenges while evaluating hedge funds’ performance.

A private equity firm makes an initial investment of USD4.7 billion into ABC company in Year 0. Seven years later, it sells its stake in the company for USD9.3 billion. Additional capital investments were made in Year 2 and in Year 3 for USD1.3 billion and USD500 million, respectively. Its MOIC is closest to: 
A 1.43x 
B 6% 
C Neither A) nor B)
?x
A is correct. Multiple of invested capital (MOIC), or money multiple is calculated using the following equation:
MOIC = (Realized value of investment + Unrealized value of investment)/(Total amount of invested capital).
MOIC = 9.3/(4.7+1.3+0.5)=1.43x
IRR of the investment is 6%.
```python
# Given values for the calculation
initial_investment = 4.7  # billion USD
additional_investment_year_2 = 1.3  # billion USD
additional_investment_year_3 = 0.5  # billion USD
final_value = 9.3  # billion USD

# Total capital invested
total_invested = initial_investment + additional_investment_year_2 + additional_investment_year_3

# MOIC formula: MOIC = Final Value / Total Invested Capital
MOIC = final_value / total_invested
MOIC
> 1.43
```



Atrium Opportunity Fund LLC hedge fund has USD150 million of capital. It generally uses leverage to invest in equity-linked notes.  Suppose Atrium’s underlying positions return 9%. If it could add leverage of USD50 million to the portfolio at a funding cost of 5%, its leveraged return would have been _closest_ to:
- A    10.33%
- B    7.7%
- C    11.2%

Which of the following categories of fund investments. according to GAAP rules, requires additional scrutiny in terms of asset values?
- A  Level 1
- B Level 2
- C Level 3
![[Pasted image 20250205232914.png]]
?x
C is correct. Level 3 assets values require additional scrutiny from investors. The models used should be appropriate and consistent. The values obtained may not reflect true liquidation values. Also, the returns may be smoothed and the volatility understated.



LO: Calculate and interpret alternative investment returns both before and after fees. 
![[Pasted image 20250205234010.png]]
?x
Alternative investment managers usually charge a management fee based on AUM and an incentive fee based on performance. However, analysts should also be aware of any custom fee arrangements in place that will affect the calculation of fees and performance. These can include such arrangements such as: fees based on liquidity terms and asset size, founder’s share, and either/or fees. 
x
It is difficult to generalize performance appraisal for these investments because returns may vary depending on how and when a particular investor invested in a particular vehicle.
x
Hedge fund index returns can be overstated due to survivorship, and backfill biases


A PE fund invests USD15 million in Portfolio Company A and USD17 million in Portfolio Company B. Company A generates a USD5 million profit, but Company B generates a USD6 million loss. The time period for the gain and loss are the same. The manager’s carried interest incentive fee is 20% of profits. The incentive fee under a European-style waterfall whole-of funds approach is:
![[Pasted image 20250205235345.png]]
- A    0
- B    USD1 million
- C    USD0.2 million

An investor is contemplating investing €100 million in either the RS Hedge Fund (RS HF) or the UV Fund of Funds (UV FOF). UV FOF has a “1 and 10” fee structure and invests 10% of its AUM in RS HF. RS HF has a standard “2 and 20” fee structure with no hurdle rate. Management fees are calculated on an annual basis on AUM at the beginning of the year. Assume that management fees and incentive fees are calculated independently. RS HF has a 30% return for the year before management and incentive fees.
Assume that the other investments in the UV FOF portfolio generate the same return before management fees as those of RS HF. The return to the investor from investing in UV FOF is _closest to_:
![[Pasted image 20250206001458.png]]
A 22.0%
B 18.8%
C 18.46%
?x
B is correct.
RS HF has a profit before fees on a €100 million investment of €30 million (= €100 million × 30%).
The management fee is €2 million (= €100 million × 2%), and the incentive fee is €6 million (= €30 million × 20%).
The return to the investor in RS HF is 22% [= (30 − 2 − 6)/100].
UV FOF earns a 22% return or €22 million profit after fees on €100 million invested with the hedge fund.
UV FOF charges the investor a management fee of €1  million (= €100 million × 1%) and an incentive fee of €2.2 million (= €22 million × 10%). The return to the investor is 18.8% [= (22 − 1 − 2.2)/100].


A PE fund makes two investments for USD10 million each in Company A and Company B. One year later Company A returns a USD13 million profit. But two years later Company B turns out to be a complete bust and is worth zero. The GP’s carried interest is 20% of aggregate profits and there is a clawback provision. How much carried interest will the GP receive in year 2?
![[Pasted image 20250206001850.png]]
- A    $2.6 million
- B    $0.6 million
- C    $0

B $0.6 million
