LO.b: Compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures. 
?x
The time-weighted rate of return measures the compound growth rate of $1 initially invested in the portfolio over a stated measurement period. Money-weighted return is the internal rate of return on money invested that considers the cash inflows and cash outflows, and calculates the return on actual investment. Money-weighted v/s time-weighted returns 
•The money-weighted rate of return is impacted by the timing and amount of cash flows. 
•The time-weighted rate of return is not impacted by the timing and amount of cash flows. 
•The time-weighted return is an appropriate performance measure if the portfolio manager does not control the timing and amount of investment. 
• On the other hand, money-weighted return is an appropriate measure if the portfolio manager has control over the timing and amount of investment.

LO: Explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line. 
?x
To identify the optimal investor portfolio, we must consider the investor’s risk preferences. The utility of each investor is best represented by his indifference curves. The optimal investor portfolio is the point at which the investor’s indifference curve is tangential to the optimal allocation line. Portfolio C in the exhibit below is the optimal investor portfolio.

CAL (P) is based on the market, not the investor’s risk preferences; it represents the most efficient portfolio for each level of risk.


LO: Describe and interpret the minimum-variance and efficient frontiers of risky assets and the global minimum-variance portfolio.
![[Pasted image 20250206224236.png]]
?x
Consider the universe of risky, investable assets. These can be combined to form many portfolios; when plotted together they form a curve. This set of portfolios is called the investment opportunity set. At any given level of return in the investment opportunity set, there will be a portfolio with minimum variance. The line combining such portfolios with minimum variance is called the minimum-variance frontier. 
![[Pasted image 20250206224323.png]]
x
The portfolio with the lowest risk or minimum variance among portfolios of all risky assets is called the global minimum-variance portfolio. The efficient frontier is the part of the minimum-variance frontier that is above the global minimumvariance portfolio. It represents the set of portfolios that will give the highest return at each risk level. Remember that the efficient frontier consists of only risky assets. There is no risk-free asset


The portfolio that _most likely_ falls below the efficient frontier is:
![[Pasted image 20250206224411.png]]
- The **efficient frontier** represents portfolios that give the highest expected return for a given level of risk (standard deviation).
- Portfolios that do not lie on the efficient frontier are considered **inefficient**, meaning they do not offer the best possible return for the risk level they assume.
?x
A is correct. Portfolio B must be the portfolio that falls below the Markowitz efficient frontier as it has lower return and higher risk than Portfolio C.


Amy has a higher risk-aversion coefficient than Susan. Given that both Amy and Susan have selected the same risky portfolio, the optimal portfolio on the capital allocation line for Susan will have:
![[Pasted image 20250206225042.png]]
- A    higher expected return than Amy’s optimal portfolio.
- B    lower expected return than Amy’s optimal portfolio.
- C    same expected return as that of Amy’s optimal portfolio.
?x
Higher expected return than Amys optimal porfolio:

Which of the following statements is _least accurate_ about the efficient frontier?
![[Pasted image 20250206225724.png]]
- A    It is the part of the minimum-variance frontier that is above the global minimum-variance portfolio.
- B    It represents the set of portfolios that will give the highest return at each risk level.
- C    It consists of risky and risk-free assets
?x
C is correct. Efficient frontier consists of only risky assets. There is no risk-free asset.


Amy has a higher risk-aversion coefficient than Susan. Given that both Amy and Susan have selected the same risky portfolio, the optimal portfolio on the capital allocation line for Susan will have: 
![[Pasted image 20250206231137.png]]
A higher expected return than Amy’s optimal portfolio. 
B lower expected return than Amy’s optimal portfolio. 
C same expected return as that of Amy’s optimal portfolio.
?x
A is correct. Susan has a low risk-aversion coefficient, therefore a high risk-tolerance. The indifference curve will intersect the capital allocation line at a higher level, giving an optimal portfolio that has a higher expected return than Amy’s optimal portfolio.


Which of the following statements is _least accurate_ about the efficient frontier?
![[Pasted image 20250206231217.png]]
- A    It is the part of the minimum-variance frontier that is above the global minimum-variance portfolio.
- B    It represents the set of portfolios that will give the highest return at each risk level.
- C    It consists of risky and risk-free assets.
?x
C is correct. Efficient frontier consists of only risky assets. There is no risk-free asset. Thus, the least accurate statement is C: It consists of risky and risk-free assets because the efficient frontier does not consider risk-free assets.


An analyst observes s return series of some asset class which demonstrated return distributions concentrated to the left with frequent small losses and few large gains. This feature is _most likely_ known as:
![[Pasted image 20250206231805.png]]
- A    negative skewness.
- B    positive skewness.
- C    kurtosis.
?x
B is correct. A distribution is said to be right skewed or positively skewed if most is concentrated to the left, and left skewed or negatively skewed if most of the distribution is concentrated to the right. A positively skewed distribution has a long tail on the right side, which means that there will be frequent small losses and few large gains.


According to utility theory, a relatively risk-averse investor will have an indifference curve that will have:
![[Pasted image 20250206232028.png]]
A higher slope coefficient.
B lower slope coefficient.
C higher convexity.
?x
The more risk-averse an investor is, the higher the slope of the indifference curve. An investor with less steep indifference curves has a lower level of risk aversion, i.e., higher risk tolerance.

The risk-return relationship for a risk seeking investor is _most likely_ to be:
- A    positive.
- B negative.
- C    neutral.
- A **risk-seeking investor** typically expects a **negative relationship** between **risk** and **return**, meaning that as the risk increases, the **expected return decreases**.
- This is in contrast to **risk-averse investors**, who prefer investments with lower risk and a stable return, all else being equal.

Mike’s portfolio consists of two stocks: X and Y. The standard deviation of returns is 0.15 for X and 0.095 for Y. The covariance between the returns of the two stocks is 0.0030. The correlation of returns between them is:
![[Pasted image 20250207005154.png]]
- A    0.2105.
- B    2.1052.
- C    4.750.
?x
![[Pasted image 20250207005437.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250207005451.png]]
A is correct.
Cov (Ri, Rj) = ρ(Ri, Rj) * σ(Ri) * σ (Rj)
ρ(Ri, Rj) = Cov (Ri, Rj) / [σ(Ri) * σ (Rj)]
ρ = 0.0030 / 0.15 * 0.095 = 0.2105.


The following two shares are included in a portfolio:
![[Pasted image 20250207005608.png]]![[Pasted image 20250207010128.png]]
The standard deviation of returns of the portfolio formed with these two stocks is _closet_ to:
- A   0.2980.
- B    0.3320.
- C    0.3680.
![[Pasted image 20250207005654.png]]
?x
0.3680.
C is correct.
SDPortfolio = [(0.65)2(0.38)2 + (0.35)2(0.52)2 + 2(065)(038)(0.35)(0.52)(0.46)]1/2
SDPortfolio = 0.3680.
```python
w1 = 0.65  # Weight of Clement Corporation
w2 = 0.35  # Weight of Telnet Corporation
sigma1 = 0.38  # Standard deviation of Clement Corporation
sigma2 = 0.52  # Standard deviation of Telnet Corporation
correlation = 0.46  # Correlation between the returns of the two stocks

# Portfolio standard deviation calculation
sigma_p = math.sqrt((w1**2 * sigma1**2) + (w2**2 * sigma2**2) + (2 * w1 * w2 * sigma1 * sigma2 * correlation))
sigma_p
```
This is the weight change how it modifies the standard deviation
