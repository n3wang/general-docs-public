## Modulo 3.1 Central Tendency and Dispersion

Measures of Central Tendency
The arithmetic mean is:: the sum of the observation values divided by the number of observations.
The sample mean is the sum of all the values in a sample of a population divided by the number of observations.
arithmetic mean: 
$$
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
$$
of arithmetic mean, we've endountered it already.


Median
The median is the midpoint of a dataset (half above and half below).
Example with an odd number of observations
Example with an even number of observations
- Median is the average of the two middle observations
