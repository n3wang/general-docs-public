## Modulo 3.1 Central Tendency and Dispersion

Measures of Central Tendency
The arithmetic mean is:: the sum of the observation values divided by the number of observations.
The sample mean is the sum of all the values in a sample of a population divided by the number of observations.
arithmetic mean: 
$$
\bar{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}
$$
of arithmetic mean, we've endountered it already.


Median
The median is the midpoint of a dataset (half above and half below).
Example with an odd number of observations
Example with an even number of observations
- Median is the average of the two middle observations
Less affected by extremedraldes ithaty the imeater.


:d Quartiles, how much of the data points the following represents ?
- less than the 3rd quartile.means: $75 \%$ of the data points are 
- less than the 6th decile:: $60 \%$ of the data points
- less than the 50th percentile (50th percentile is the median):: 50% of the data points

- With an odd number of values, 50 th percentile is the middle value when observations are ordered from least to greatest.

#### Box and Whisker Plot

![[Pasted image 20250717035601.png]]
:p What is a Box and Whisker Plot? What does the upper obsiravation and lowest observation represent? How about the box top and bottom? Where is that located on the plot?
??x

|Element|Meaning|Location on Plot|
|---|---|---|
|**Lowest Observation**|Minimum value (excluding outliers)|End of the left whisker|
|**Lower Quartile (Q1)**|25th percentile — 25% of the data falls below this|Bottom of the box (left edge)|
|**Median (Q2)**|50th percentile — middle of the data|Line inside the box|
|**Upper Quartile (Q3)**|75th percentile — 75% of the data falls below this|Top of the box (right edge)|
|**Upper Observation**|Maximum value (excluding outliers)|End of the right whisker|

:d what does the following describe in finance?
Dispersion:: is defined as the variability around the central tendency
Tradeoff:: in finance and investments between reward (return) and variability (risk)
Range:: is the distance between the largest and smallest value of the dataset from the arithmetic mean
mean absolute deviation:: is the average of the absolute deviations from the arithmetic mean



### Sample Variance and Standard Deviation

Sample Variance and Standard Deviation

$$
s^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)^2}{n-1} \quad s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(x_i-\bar{x}\right)^2}{n-1}}
$$


Note that for sample variance, the sum of the squared deviations is divided by $n-1$ instead of $n$.
What is the bessel correction? :: Is when on Sample Variance we divide the sum of the squared deviations by `n-1` instead of `n`


#### Problem

Annual returns data: $30 \%, 12 \%, 25 \%, 20 \%, 23 \%$
:p Calculate the sample variance and sample standard deviation.
?x
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \bar{X}=\frac{30+12+25+20+23}{5}=22 \% \\
& s^2=\frac{(30-22)^2+(12-22)^2+(25-22)^2+(20-22)^2+(23-22)^2}{5-1}=44.5
\end{aligned}
$$


Target Downside Deviation: Example
Annual returns data: $30 \%, 12 \%, 25 \%, 20 \%, 23 \%$
Using a target of $24 \%$, what is the target downside deviation?
?x
$$
\begin{aligned}
& 30 \%-24 \%=6 \% \\
& 12 \%-24 \%=-12 \% \\
& 25 \%-24 \%=1 \% \\
& 20 \%-24 \%=-4 \% \\
& 23 \%-24 \%=-1 \%
\end{aligned}
$$






##  Module 3.2: Skewness, Kurtosis, and Correlation

#### Skeweness

Positive Skew = Right Skew
Positive skew has outliers in the right tail.
Skew absolute values > 0.5 are significant.
Mean is most affected by outliers.


| Positive Skew                        | Negative Skew                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| ![[Pasted image 20250731203746.png]] | ![[Pasted image 20250731203754.png]] |


What does Positive or Negative Skew mean?


Kurtosis
This measures the degree to which a distribution is more or less peaked than a normal distribution.
Leptokurtic (kurtosis > 3) is more peaked with fatter tails (more extreme outliers).
