## Module 5.1: Probability Models for Portfolio Return and Risk
:d Shortfall Risk and Roy's Safety-First Ratio
Shortfall risk is:: the probability that a portfolio will fall below a particular target value or return over a given period.
Roy's safety-first criterion specifies:: a minimum acceptable level of return, called the threshold level return.

$$
R S F=\frac{E\left(R_P\right)-R_L}{\sigma_P} \quad R_L=\text { threshold return }
$$
- The higher the RSF value, the lower the probability of shortfall.
- Assuming normally distributed returns, RSF is a $z$-value.
- If you need **at least 3% return**, shortfall risk tells you:

What is Shortfall Risk?
It's the probability that a portfolio’s return will fall below a threshold level (like a minimum acceptable return).
For example: If you need at least 3% return, shortfall risk tells you:
?x
“What’s the chance I’ll earn **less than 3%**?”

#### Example Portfolio A
Used to compare portfolios on how well they protect against shortfalls.
$$
\mathrm{RSF}=\frac{E\left(R_P\right)-R_L}{\sigma_P}
$$
Where:
- $E\left(R_P\right)$ : Expected return of the portfolio
- $R_L$ : Minimum acceptable return (threshold)
- $\sigma_P$ : Standard deviation of the portfolio
* Bigger RSF $\rightarrow$ less chance of shortfall $\rightarrow$ better

| Portfolio | Expected Return | Std Dev | RSF |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | --- |
| A         | 9%              | 12%     | ?   |
| B         | 11%             | 20%     | ?   |
| C         | 6.6%            | 8.2%    | ?   |
:p The threshold is **3%**. Can you calculate RSF for **Portfolio A**?
??x
$$
\mathrm{RSF}_A=\frac{9-3}{12}=\frac{6}{12}=0.5
$$


That means Portfolio A is half a standard deviation above the shortfall threshold.
