A is correct. Â The corporate form of business structure is preferred when capital requirements are greater than what could be raised through other business structures.

B is not correct because conflicts of interest can occur in corporations when management places their own interests, or the interests of other stakeholders, above those of the shareholders.

C is not correct because in many jurisdictions, corporate profits are taxed twice (double taxation): once at the corporate level and again at the individual level when profits are distributed as dividends to the owner
