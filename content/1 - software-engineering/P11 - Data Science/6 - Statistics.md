### Properties of Random Variable

For any given random variable X, the following properties hold true (below we assume X is continuous, but it also holds true for discrete random variables). The expectation (average value, or mean) of a random variable is given by the integral of the value

The expectation (average value, or mean) of a random variable is given by the integral of the value of $X$ with its probability density function (PDF) $f x(x)$ :

$$
\mu=E[X]=\int^x x f_X(x) d x
