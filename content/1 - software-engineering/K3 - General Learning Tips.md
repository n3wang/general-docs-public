1. **Delayed Repetition**: If learning from Youtube videos, please watch the whole concept before repeating on your own. This is a small test to improve your memory as well as your steps by steps practice.
2. **Document and Overlay Documentation**: Create a small copy of the oficial documentation, and references to it. by creating practice sheets on the end of it. That can be practiced from Obsidian
3. Learning from Videos Courses
	1. Watching: If watching Tutorial videos like: [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRybm9lXW2c&list=LL&index=6) try out watching the result, then attempting to replicate the results using whatever documentation is available
	2. These are toDarkarior448!
	3. be done on parallel with custom projects, such as react tutorial + a react application that you will be developing on the side.
	4. CONTRIBUTOR MINDSET: Learn things not from a user perspective including programing, but "How can I use, improve and contribute to this tool?" mindset
4. **Work and mantain long term Unique Projects:** If you had learnt (or at least increase some of your confidence) is by tackling different type of architectures and type of applications in general.

Some stacks that sort of dont wanna see again are python and react, but the ideal would be to continue working on them.
