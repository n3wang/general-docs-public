The idea:

- Follow up [Course: PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning/learn/lecture/32943718#overview)


Materials
- Github [mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning: Materials for the Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning: Zero to Mastery course.](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning)
- Pytorch Actual Github [pytorch/pytorch: Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)


Final Project
- Replicate Pytorch papers on a weekly basis and explain on Youtube and here,
