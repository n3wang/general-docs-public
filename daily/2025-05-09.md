Negotiating on salary

- I would hope to be making starting at 60 000 a year in a positition
- I believe my years of experience working as a mid level engineering 
- But I am hoping this salary to vary depending on the final position and location of the client

Questions:

- As you know at the moment I am working in Argentina as a Software Engineer at JP Morgan, and I am taking advantage of the situation to learn best practices. While the brute salary is not as high as the one being offered by you, is a competitive salary in Argentina (more than enough to cover livign in aargneitna Expenses)
	- I am not fully prepared to move yet as for the remainding of this year I had promised my family to take care of them. Do you think that it would be possible to delay this into a future date e.g. in 2026? I would really like to work with them 
	- At the same time, from your end you I believe that in a further date, my technical skills will improve by a lot, since I will be soaking knowledge, best practices, experiences from my current job at JP morgan, But I am planning to return to the states, not just this year.  

Dear Eddy,

Thank you again for the opportunity and for scheduling the final offer talk. 

Before our conversation, I wanted to share a few thoughts to help guide the discussion:

1. **Salary Expectation**:  
    Given my experience working as a mid-level engineer, I would hope to start at a salary around **$60,000 per year**, though I understand this may vary depending on the final role and client location. I'm open to discussing adjustments based on those details.
    
2. **Current Situation**:  
    As you may know, I am currently working in Argentina as a Software Engineer at JPMorgan. While the salary here is not as high as the one offered by BeaconFire, it is considered competitive for Argentina and allows me to focus on learning best practices at a global company.
    
3. **Timing and Relocation**:  
    Due to family commitments, I had promised to remain in Argentina through the end of this year. Would it be possible to consider a **delayed start date**, Ideally in **early 2026**? I am very interested in working with BeaconFire, and this timeline would allow me to continue gaining valuable experience that would benefit your team in the long run.
    

Here the :



Please let me know if this could be a flexible arrangement, and I’m looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,  
Nelson Wang
