Inspiration comes from Daily Repetition in Spanish from Fernandos Habit. The idea is to either take part of the book, to explain problems in Chinese for some reason. Improve your knowledge and language at the same time. Videos can be recorded and mass edited and uploaded on a specific date e.g. Friday. 


Things that can be handled on the daily basis:

- Book Reports
- Algorithms
- After your classes from University of Palermo e.g. Algebra...and then attempt with other classes. Perhaps using Obsidian Slides? it could work.


You can follow the same pattern when it comes to teaching. 


- Add names to context and refer to ask a random student everytime to ask. (to simulate that realism)
